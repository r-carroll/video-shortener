1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Many artists rose to prominence in the 20th century around the world,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 but as I was thinking about this message, there were two artists

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 who became world-famous in their respective disciplines in the 20th century.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Norman Rockwell was born in 1894, and his paintings

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 gained national attention as they often expressed really the simplicity

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 of life in America, small town America, rural America, family,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 and America. The paintings are clear and clean,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 and it's easy to understand exactly what it was that Norman Rockwell

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 was trying to communicate in most of his paintings,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 of course, this one on the screen, is one that you're very familiar with.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 You've probably seen many times before in your life, but there was another artist.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 His name was Pablo Picasso. He was born 13 years before Rockwell.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The Spanish artist actually gained international fame for his contemporary masterpieces.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Now, as you can see, the styles are drastically different.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 They're not even close to similar, but yet we can see

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and use these to illustrate what James wanted believers to know

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 when he wrote to them concerning wisdom.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 The reality is this, that life can be peaceful or life can be disordered.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And living the good life really does come down to making a choice

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 that each one of us must make.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So let me ask you to turn in your copy of God's Word to James chapter number three.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 As we continue our series, we're more than halfway through the book.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We'll finish God willing, chapter three today,

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 and then we'll continue one in our series as the Lord allows us to gather together

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 each Sunday to study his Word.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 But as we've looked at James, we've seen that this book is largely misunderstood by so many people.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So many people believe that James does not believe in salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Why? Because the focus of his writing is really on the works that accompany the Christian life.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 In other words, those who claim to be redeemed, those who claim to be saved by faith in Jesus Christ alone,

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 they must have evidence of that salvation that flows through them and then is obvious to others who observing their life.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And for that reason, people have looked at James and thought, man, he doesn't understand what Paul was saying that salvation is by grace.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 No, no, they're coming at it from two different angles.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Paul is looking at making sure that people will understand and know that salvation cannot come through works at all.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And anybody who's trying to trust in their works for salvation is trusting in that which can never save them.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 James is coming along and saying those who are saved, you must have works that demonstrate the authenticity,

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 the realness, the sincerity of your faith.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And how do you know that you have a genuine saving faith in Christ?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Well, according to James, it's by your works. Faith works.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So look with me if you would. Chapter three, beginning in verse number 13.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And James says, who is wise and understanding among you?

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Now you have to understand that James spoke of wisdom quite often in this letter.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And he wanted people to understand that wisdom is necessary. The wisdom is required for life as a follower of Christ.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So he says, who is wise and understanding among you by his good conduct, let him show his works in the meateness of wisdom.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exists, there will be disorder in every vile practice.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Father, I ask that you would help us to understand your word. Clearly, if you don't help us to understand,

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 we have no capacity of doing so. And so Lord, we pray that as we look at this text that the Holy Spirit who resides in those who are believers, those who have faith in Jesus Christ alone as Lord and Savior,

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 God, I pray that that Holy Spirit would open our eyes and teach us, instruct us, and then God, I pray that the Holy Spirit would also empower us to not simply say this is good to know,

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 but it would empower us that he would empower us to live this out daily. And I ask it in Christ's name, amen.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 The wisdom that guides your life cannot be hidden. If we were to take these verses and extrapolate really the meaning,

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 that the overall meaning of what James is trying to communicate to us here, it's this message that wisdom that guides your life cannot be hidden.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 So from the very beginning of this letter, James has established that we desperately need wisdom from God.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So we're going to replace in James 3, turn back to James chapter 1. Let me demonstrate to you what I'm talking about in verse number 5 of James 1.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 He says this, if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 James is not saying, hey, there are some of you who don't lack wisdom. There are some of you who have all the wisdom and understanding that you need.

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And if you find those of you don't have that wisdom, you need to ask God. Know the idea is this, that none of us have all the wisdom that we need to navigate through the journey of the various trials of many different kinds that we experience in this life.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 In other words, we all need wisdom. And James has the source of the wisdom that you need as you're navigating your life.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 He doesn't come from this earth that comes from God. So ask of God, and he will give it liberally to you. He will give it to you.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 He won't reproach you for asking. He's not going to be the kind of God who when you come to him and say, God, I need wisdom to help me get through this circumstance.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I need wisdom to help guide me through this trial, through this difficulty, through this test. God's not going to give it to you and say, now don't ask again.

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 That's not the way God works. God gives it and continues to give it as you need it, as you ask of it from him in faith.

65
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so the text before us today, we see again the need for wisdom and the apostle begins by asking a question.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And this question is worded in such a way that I think every one of us in this room would like to stand up and answer the question this way.

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I am. Now what's the question? Who is wise and understanding among you? Wouldn't you like to be able to stand up and rightfully proclaim? That's me.

68
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I am wise and I have understanding. But the reality is, while we would all like to stand up and claim to have all the knowledge we need and all the wisdom that we need, none of us can.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But what James is really driving at in this question. And we see it as he explains in the next phrase, the next sentence, he's not saying that this is something that we simply need to declare.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 It's not now nor has it ever been about making a claim. The reality is that the kind of wisdom that we need guides your life and it will eventually become obvious to you and to those who know you look what he says, who is wise and understanding among you.

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 By his good conduct, let him show his works in the meatness of wisdom.

72
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You know what James is saying here? Don't just tell me. Show me. Don't just tell me how wise you are. Don't just tell me how understanding you are. Show me.

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 How wise and understanding you are. And how do you show me by his good conduct?

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You can't get away from this truth no matter how hard you try. That what you are is eventually expressed in what you do.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And the kind of wisdom that guides your life will always be expressed in how you live.

76
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 The writer of Psalms opens up the Psalms with the description of the blessed or the wise man.

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord and on his law.

78
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 He meditates day and night.

79
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 The question would be how do we know that a person is wise? How do we know that a person is blessed?

80
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And the Psalmist says, here's how you know by where they walk, by where they stand, by where they sit, by what they love.

81
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 You can tell the wisdom that is guiding a person's life by those things, all those things are actions, they are things that we do.

82
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 This is why James says, it's not just about making a claim, I'm wise and I'm understanding.

83
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 No, no, no, if you make that claim, then you must buy your good conduct, the word good here, it is not the normal Greek word used for good.

84
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 This word has the idea of that which is lovely, wholesome, helpful, noble, or praiseworthy.

85
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It's a way of life that James is talking about, whose goodness is plain for everyone else to see.

86
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 We might put it this way, it's the good life, it's a good kind of life, it's a good quality of life.

87
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And when we think of quality of life, we think the house we live in, the car we drive, the money that we have in the bank, the neighborhood in which we reside.

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 No, no, no, that doesn't have anything to do from a spiritual perspective of the good life.

89
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 The good life is what does your life reflect about God? What wisdom is guiding your life?

90
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Now before we go any further, we need to understand what wisdom is, there are a lot of different definitions.

91
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 If you go to chat GPT, if you go to chat GPT cracks me up, by the way.

92
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 How many of you have done anything with chat GPT? Some of you have, it is crazy what that thing can do.

93
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 But if you go to chat GPT or you go to websters or Google or, and you look up the definition of wisdom, you're going to find roughly the same definition.

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And sometimes it can be a little bit wordy. So many years ago, I don't remember if I came across this and adopted it as my own, or if I somehow just cleverly wrote this down.

95
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I can't remember what it is, but there's a little definition, a working definition that I've used for years of wisdom.

96
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And it's simply this, that wisdom is knowledge applied. That wisdom is really nothing more than knowledge applied.

97
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 We gain knowledge, right? But that knowledge does no good if we do not apply it properly.

98
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And so I can know that it's a really bad idea to take a nap in the Southbound lanes of Cleveland Avenue at 5 p.m.

99
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I can know that, that's not a good idea. But if that knowledge doesn't prevent me from going and taking a nap in the Southbound lanes of Cleveland Avenue at 5 p.m.

100
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Then I'm going to be roadkill, right? Wisdom is knowledge applied, that's not a good idea, therefore I won't do that.

101
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 No matter if fact I'm not going to take a nap in the middle of Cleveland Avenue at any time of the day, period.

102
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because it's always going to be a bad idea. Wisdom is knowledge applied.

103
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And so one author wrote this, the Bible, nowhere places much value on knowledge that remains merely cerebral or credal.

104
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Now it's not saying that it's a bad thing to have knowledge, study to show that self-approved unto God.

105
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 A workman needs not re-ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth. It's a good thing to gain knowledge. It's a good thing to study the word.

106
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 It's a good thing to sit under the preaching, the faithful preaching and teaching of the word. Those are all good and right things.

107
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It's a good thing to know what the creeds are and to memorize biblically faithful creeds. It's a good thing to know doctrine.

108
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 It's a good thing to know about God. It's a good thing. But listen, if all we gain is knowledge and we never ever put that knowledge into action, we're missing the point.

109
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And we cannot then consider ourselves wise.

110
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 The author continues, nothing is known, listen to this, nothing is known until it reshapes the life.

111
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Nothing is known until it reshapes your life. In other words, knowledge applied has an impact and directly affects how you live. It shapes your life.

112
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 James goes on to say the life of Godly wisdom is a good life, but he also says it's a humble life. He says show his works in the meekness of wisdom.

113
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 The idea here is, is meekness power under control. It's not weakness at all, but the better understanding of this is the humility of wisdom.

114
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 What is James saying? He's saying a humble heart is vital to having a quality life, a person who is then guided by Godly wisdom is not an arrogant person.

115
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 We're going to see that expressed throughout this text.

116
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 So as we look at this, we have to ask the question, do we want a good life?

117
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I would venture to say that most everyone in this room, if asked, do you want to live a good life? Do you want to have a good life? Most everyone in this room who is sane would say yes.

118
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I would question your sanity if you were like, no, don't really care if I have a good life.

119
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Now, we have to understand that the idea of a good life as given to us in this text is not the idea of a good life, the world promotes.

120
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Marketing focuses on selling consumers on the idea and benefit of a good life.

121
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And what do they claim as a good life? You have all the amenities. You have plenty of money in the bank, you drive the nice car.

122
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 You have the best clothes, you have the kind of job, you hang out with the right kind of people. That's a good life.

123
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 No, no, no, that's not anything close to a biblical understanding of a good life.

124
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 In the text, we see that the good life is all about living according to the right kind of wisdom.

125
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But yet, you're sitting here and you're thinking, you know what, I want my life to be meaningful, I want my life to be purposeful, I want the ideal marriage, I want perfect children, I want the happiest of happy homes.

126
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 There are others who desperately want other people to want their life. They want to depict themselves in their lives in such a way that others would look at them and say, I want that life.

127
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And then people will do whatever they can to get others to be envious of the kind of life they're living. Some go into enormous debt.

128
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 So that others see all the things that they have and they're like, man, that's what I want. Others put on a fantastic show, wearing all sorts of different masks to show how good you've got it in the hopes that someone will become envious of you.

129
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And then we talk about a good life, man, we don't want chaos, we don't want disruption, we want the Norman Rockwell, but all too often we experience the Picasso, the crazy and disordered.

130
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And you struggle to understand why life isn't the way you always imagined it would be, you're haunted by the thought of what life should be and you're frustrated by those who tell you what it could be.

131
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I've got news for you today, God wants your life to be well-ordered and fruitful. He wants your life to reflect his wisdom. God also makes it possible to live wisely.

132
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 As we work our way through this text today, my prayer is this that you'll see that there are two wisdoms. The text clearly delineates, makes plain that there are two different kinds of wisdoms and they don't overlap at all.

133
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 They are contrasted against one another. And here's the thing, one of those two wisdoms is going to guide your life.

134
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Did you hear that? Do you understand that? One of those two wisdoms is going to guide your life and so you need to know what these wisdoms are and you need to know how these wisdoms are going to affect you.

135
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And so the wisdom that guides your life according to James, it cannot be hidden. But what are these two wisdoms that James reveals? Well, first of all, there is the wisdom that brings turmoil.

136
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 James says in verse number 14, playing off of what he's already written by his good conduct, let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. But this is meant to be contrastive in nature.

137
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 He's painting a contrast. He's saying, okay, there's the good works and the good conduct in this beautiful kind of life that comes from this wisdom that comes from God.

138
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 But there is another kind of wisdom. And if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boast and be false to the truth.

139
00:19:43,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 The reality is James wrote much about the good works that are produced by genuine faith in Christ. But if you know anything about James, if you've gotten anything from our study so far, then you realize or you must realize that James never missed an opportunity to deal with the reason for our struggle.

140
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Why do we struggle? A lot of times we think that our struggles are external in nature. James always says, no, no, it's not about external, it's about internal.

141
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So when we looked at the idea of temptation, we saw that temptation is not something that is produced externally, but it is produced internally.

142
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 It's a problem here. When we looked at the tongue, we saw that the issue with what we say isn't necessarily determined by the things that are happening around us or the people who are influencing us, no, the things that we say reflect what Jesus said, what's going on in the heart for what's in the heart comes out of the mouth.

143
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And so now what does James say? If you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition, what's the next phrase in your heart? He's saying, this is an internal problem brothers and sisters.

144
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 This isn't something that is being forced upon you from the outside, no, no, no, this is an internal problem, this is an issue of the heart.

145
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 The reality is that everything flows from the heart. And so what James is saying is if you have bitter jealousy and you have selfish ambition in your heart, it's evident that you are not following the wisdom that God gives.

146
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And to that he says, you must not boast. The idea can be that they were boasting about it and he's telling them here not to boast or he's saying don't start boasting about it, boasting about what?

147
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 The fact that you claim to be wise and understanding but internally you're filled with bitter jealousy and selfish ambition.

148
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And those two things James looks at as motives that drives everything else in our life.

149
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And all of that can be summarized this way that you are self-centered, that you are self-concerned, that you're jealous because somebody has what you believe you do.

150
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And you deserve that you think you ought to have. And that you have selfish ambition because you think that your priorities, that your desires supersede the needs of anybody else.

151
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And you must acquiesce to you so that you get what you want because you think you deserve it. What James is saying here is that internally you sit on the throne of your own life.

152
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And that everyone and everything is to serve you. But at the same time you're saying I have wisdom and I have knowledge. And James is saying no, no, don't boast about something that isn't true.

153
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 It's not true even though you wish it were true. That's what it means to be false to the truth. It's the idea of I'm going to lie to myself about my own condition and the hopes that eventually I start to believe that it's true.

154
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I know inside that life is all about me and that I really don't care about anybody else and I really don't care what happens to anybody else.

155
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But you know what, I'm going to put on a show. I'm going to create a pretense that I am wise and that I am knowledgeable. And James is like no, no, no, don't be arrogant and convince yourself that something is true when it's not.

156
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 If you haven't learned this by now, James is very pastoral and he uses terms of endearing and affection, brethren all the way through the text. But at the same time he's not afraid to stand up and get in your face.

157
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 He's not afraid to say, listen, this is a problem if you are doing this. The idea of being false to the truth isn't just that you're trying so hard to believe a lie that you've told yourself but it's also something where you'll attempt to change the truth.

158
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 We understand that truth is not subjective, that it's objective, it's absolute. But yet there are people today who try their best to fit the truth to their own belief or their lifestyle.

159
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And so they'll say, I am wise and I have knowledge and then they'll try to convince themselves that a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man.

160
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Just for example, we know biologically that's not possible and our heart breaks for people who believe their truth on those issues.

161
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 We don't look at these people as the problem with society, we should have compassion, we should have love.

162
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 But as we said before, love does not turn to blight and eye to the truth. Love communicates the truth.

163
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Because if we truly love those who are struggling with believing a lie, our heart is that they might actually begin to believe the truth and have their lives molded by the truth.

164
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And so James is saying, listen, if you claim to be wise and understanding, but yet you're motivated by bitter jealousy and selfish ambition that resides in your heart, you're just lying to yourself against the truth.

165
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And the truth is James categorizes it at least twice in this letter is the gospel itself.

166
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And then he clarifies, he says, this wisdom, this wisdom that isn't like the wisdom that expresses itself in good conduct, showing its works in the maintenance of wisdom, this wisdom that is motivated by bitter jealousy and selfish ambition, that you use to lie to yourself.

167
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, this is not wisdom that finds its source in God that is given to us from Him.

168
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Remember the God who will give this to you liberally, if you ask Him.

169
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 This kind of wisdom is not from God, but James says it is earthly, unspearial and demonic.

170
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And one of those words mean, earthly simply means that which is of the earth, it's bound by time and space, it has its source not in God, but in a world in a system that is broken and fallen, that is cursed and sinful.

171
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 It is earthly, it makes sense to those who themselves are sinful, broken under the curse.

172
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 James says it is unspearial.

173
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Unspearial simply means it originates, again, not from God, but from self.

174
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So it's not just that which fits this world, but it's that which comes and arises from our own fallenness, from self, from a heart that is desperately wicked, a heart that is deceptive above all things.

175
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 It comes from the natural man who cannot relate to God, why? Because they are dead and they are trespasses and they are sins.

176
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Therefore they are not spiritual in that they have a part of them, an immature part of them that is living and responds to God, because he has made it alive and active.

177
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But it's that which comes from self and demonic.

178
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 What does that mean? One author put it this way, it reflects a philosophy or pattern of thinking so contrary to God's truth that it could be endorsed by Satan himself,

179
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 that it fits neatly into the system of the world, that it cannot be distinguished from that which Satan himself would and could endorse.

180
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And then James explains what happens when we are guided by this kind of wisdom.

181
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 For where jealousy and selfish ambition, again these are those motives that he already referred to back in verse 14 where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be, this is the result, disorder and every vile practice.

182
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Do you see the progression here?

183
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Jealousy and selfish ambition are in your heart. You are guided by this worldly wisdom that says that jealousy and selfish ambition are okay, you be you, you get what you need to get, it's all about you.

184
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And so you let your life be guided by this and all of that's internal. Listen, you can't tell if I am filled with selfish ambition, you can't tell if I am filled with bitter jealousy.

185
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Why? Because it's internal and you don't know what motivates my heart to do anything.

186
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I can't assign motives to you, you can't assign motives to me, but here's what James is saying, what is in the heart, the wisdom that guides your life will eventually be expressed, it will eventually be made obvious and evident to those who are looking around why because there will be disorder and every vile practice.

187
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 There's going to be disorder internally, what does that word mean? It means chaos, it means instability. Back in chapter 1, James used this word to talk about a double-minded man who is unstable in all of his ways.

188
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 In chapter 3, verse number 8, he talked about the tongue being a restless evil. And here he uses the same kind of word again.

189
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It can be an internal disorder, but listen, if internally you're disorganized and chaotic and unstable, it's only a matter of time before that begins to express itself in every facet of life.

190
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It begins to express itself in your marriage relationship and your parenting. It begins to express itself in how you deal with co-workers. It begins to express itself in how you deal with situations in issues and other brothers and sisters in the church.

191
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 So many churches have been completely destroyed by those who would stand up and say, I have wisdom and I have knowledge and yet they are filled with bitter jealousy and selfish ambition. It's in their heart and then it begins to be expressed in their own life when something happens that they don't like in the church.

192
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 What do they do? James chapter 4 says, what causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is this not your passions that are at war within you?

193
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 You desire and you do not have, so you murder, you covet, you cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel, you do not have because you do not ask.

194
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 The wisdom that guides your life will affect you internally but it will cause chaos externally.

195
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 It also leads to every vile practice. This is basically that which is worthless, that which is immoral. It's a very general term but you can understand what he's saying.

196
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 If you're not being guided by the right kind of wisdom it will always then lead you down the wrong path.

197
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 This kind of wisdom manifests itself in disorder and immorality and we know that the world today is dominated by this kind of wisdom.

198
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 This isn't just a Western problem, this isn't just an American problem. This kind of wisdom is on display for us everywhere we look.

199
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Surely you have looked around at some point over the last several months and read a new story or watched something on television or you've seen something on social media that caused you scratch your head and say what is going on here?

200
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 None of this makes sense. What's happening?

201
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 We look around at the world and it seems like everything is quite literally falling apart that is being ripped apart at the seams and we're wondering what is going on.

202
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Well guess what? You came to church today and you have the answer right here.

203
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 The world is pursuing a wisdom that does not come from God and it's being expressed now in so many different ways.

204
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 This kind of wisdom leads to conflict. What do you think is behind what's going on in Israel right now?

205
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 What do you think is behind that? Yes, I understand that there is hatred. I understand that there is strife that goes back thousands of years.

206
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 But listen, what we're seeing is the symptom of a root cause and the root cause is what? Worldly wisdom, bitter jealousy, selfish ambition.

207
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 We want what we want and we're willing to pick up arms and do whatever we have to to get what we want.

208
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And no president, no prime minister, no public official can make things better.

209
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Not at all. If we look to our leaders to solve this problem, we will only always be disappointed because they can't do it.

210
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Because James says this is a problem of the heart. And we know that this kind of wisdom causes enormous pain.

211
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 It leads to broken homes and marriages. It leads to abuse of all kinds.

212
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 It leads to unspeakable damage done by one person to another.

213
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And many of you bear the scars of those who have damaged you wounded you deeply because they walked in this kind of wisdom.

214
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 And they didn't care about you. They cared only about themselves. And they used you and they abused you to get what they wanted.

215
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And my heart breaks for people in that situation. My heart breaks for those in that circumstance.

216
00:37:47,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 But listen, the only hope that exists for eradicating this kind of wisdom and the disaster it inflicts is Christ.

217
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 He's the only one. This is why we, as leaders of Crosspoint, ask those who are members and those who regularly attend and crosspoint home to join us in giving generously to missions.

218
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Because the nations need to know that the hope that they're looking for can only be found in Christ.

219
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 That as they place their faith and trust in Jesus alone, they will no longer be enslaved to this earthly, unspeakable, demonic kind of wisdom that promotes only self.

220
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 No, no, they'll be broken free from that shackle, those chains. And they will have the opportunity then to live by a new kind of wisdom, a different kind of wisdom.

221
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 This is why we emphasize missions and partner with missionaries. Jesus Christ, brothers and sisters, is the answer because the only way earthly wisdom can be replaced is when a sinner is given a new heart.

222
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And they are born again and they possess the Holy Spirit and his power to turn from self-centered wisdom resides within them. Christ is the answer.

223
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 And so there is a wisdom that brings turmoil and then there is a wisdom that brings peace.

224
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And then the wisdom provides a clear, unmistakable contrast between the wisdom of the earth and the wisdom that comes from God.

225
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 We see it in verse number 17. Again, the word translated but is contrastive in nature.

226
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 It's intended so that we see that there is a distinction between the two things that he's been describing here. The wisdom from above.

227
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 There is a wisdom that comes from the earth. There is a wisdom that comes down from above. The wisdom from above is a God-sourced wisdom. It's a wisdom that God gives, liberally to those his people who ask.

228
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 We're not to be confused about the two kinds of wisdom. We're not to look at these kinds of wisdom as a venn diagram where two circles overlap each other.

229
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 And so there's some truth here in the middle. And no, no, no. There is the worldly wisdom and there is Godly wisdom and the two don't cross over.

230
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 And one of those two wisdoms is going to direct and guide your life. The result of applying the wisdom from above, James shows, is remarkably different from applying the wisdom of the world.

231
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Notice he says here, but the wisdom from above is first pure. Now, when Pastor Nate gets here early in the morning on Sunday,

232
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 he'll walk into this room and this room is pretty much pitch black when there are no lights on. And what does he do? First, he turns on the light. Why?

233
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Because if he doesn't, he's going to run into a chair or a table, he's going to trip over whatever. Because it's dark and you can't see. When James says this kind of wisdom is first pure, he's not talking about in chronological order, he's talking about in order of importance.

234
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 In other words, this must be true for everything else on this list to be true. And so here, James is saying there is an opposite motive for those who employ the wisdom from above.

235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 The wisdom of the earth, they are motivated by jealousy and selfish ambition, but those who live according to the wisdom that comes from above, they are motivated by purity.

236
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 That there is a distinctness here. It's the opposite of self-centeredness. And then he says those who are motivated by this, their life then is expressed in these things.

237
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Peaceable means they're peace-loving, they're peace-promoting people, not like the 60s and 70s peace-dude hippies. No, that's not what he's talking about.

238
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 He's talking about instead of those who promote strife because it's all about themselves, these people seek to make peace.

239
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Jesus said, bless through the peacemakers, for they shall see God. It's the opposite of being contentious. He says that they are gentle, meaning they're considerate, they're courteous, kind, patient.

240
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 He says that they are open to reason. Now, what does that mean? It doesn't mean that those who live by godly wisdom are naive pushovers.

241
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Nor does it mean that those who are led by godly wisdom are open to believing lies, the lies behind worldly wisdom. It simply means this, that those who are guided by godly wisdom, they are teachable.

242
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 They have a teachable spirit.

243
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 They're not someone who is stubborn just to be stubborn. I said last week, some of you think that sarcasm is a spiritual gift. Some others think stubbornness is a spiritual gift.

244
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 You think, you know, I'm going to be a tree planted by the river of water as an eye shall not be moved, no matter what.

245
00:43:47,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 The idea is that you come alongside of one who is guided by godly wisdom and you show them the truth of the word of God and maybe the way they're living, maybe something that they believe conflicts with what God's word clearly says and you teach them and they receive it.

246
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 And they're instructed by it means that they're conformed by the word, not themselves.

247
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Means that there's someone who wants to learn and be formed by truth open to change that is driven by the word of God and their sanctification and Christ's likeness.

248
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Full of mercy, they have concerned for people who suffer not only forgiving those who have wronged you.

249
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 We understand the idea of mercy as it relates to Christ in us is that we don't receive from God what we rightly deserve, which is judgment, condemnation, the wrath of God because in placing our faith and trust in Christ Jesus took all of that.

250
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 And so now we receive mercy from God and we receive grace meaning that we receive a salvation and forgiveness that we do not deserve but it means more than that here it has the idea of demonstrating kindness and compassion to those who need kindness and compassion.

251
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Good fruits, it's a spiritual harvest that proves that God is at work in you.

252
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Listen, the fruit does not make you a believer but the fruit will always reveal if you are impartial and sincere.

253
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 It has the idea of undivided in mind, wisdom that does not waver unhypocritical.

254
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 So what James is saying here is that Godly wisdom isn't too faced, that it's consistent, that it's real, that it's authentic.

255
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Notice James isn't saying that these people are perfect but he is saying this that these are the characteristics of those who are guided by Godly wisdom.

256
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Those who have shunned being guided by worldly wisdom and adopted Godly wisdom.

257
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 The contrast should be evident when the life of a believer is held up next to the life of an unbeliever.

258
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 He says, a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

259
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 Do you see the difference?

260
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 Worldly wisdom, jealousy and selfish ambition, disorder and every vile practice, Godly wisdom that is pure leads to a harvest of righteousness which is sown in peace by those who make peace.

261
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Listen, the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life and this is what James is driving at is obvious, especially when you live as if you believe God's word is true and has authority over your life.

262
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Now I want to make sure you understand something.

263
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 James made it clear at the outset this is not ever about making a claim.

264
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 It's about showing or demonstrating that your life is guided by wisdom.

265
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 When Peter was talking Cornelius in Acts 10, he said this about Jesus that he only went about doing good.

266
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 So if we look at all of these characteristics here, man, the thing that we should see is not ourselves and how we stack up to this but the thing we ought to see is Christ.

267
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 Because he is the one who was never motivated by jealousy and selfish ambition.

268
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 He's the one who never displayed disorder and vile practice.

269
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 He's the one who was always pure and motive, peaceable, gentle, full of mercy, good fruits and partial sense here.

270
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 He is the one who perfectly exemplified all of these things for us.

271
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 Therefore he is the standard because he showed us what the wisdom of God looks like as it's lived out daily.

272
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 And if we're not careful, brothers and sisters, we're going to miss the point of this text.

273
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 And so I need to say this.

274
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 I don't have a lot of time to say it, but I'm going to say it anyway.

275
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 It's very easy for us to look at a text like this and see a checklist.

276
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 All right, well, if I want a good life, then I guess I have to make myself become pure and peaceable and gentle and open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits and partial sense here.

277
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 And so we put our name at the top of the list. We put the list down and then we start to check to see and evaluate, okay, am I doing that? Check, check, check, check.

278
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 That's not why James is giving us this text.

279
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 That is not at all what James is trying to communicate to us here.

280
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 It's not, please hear this clearly. It's not about doing certain things.

281
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 It's not about applying a checklist of virtues to make you a better person and ensure that you're living the good life.

282
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 You can try it, but here's what's going to happen.

283
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 You're going to fall on your face every time because in and of yourself, you don't have the capacity to live this out faithfully on a regular basis.

284
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 So what's the hope here? Simple.

285
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, and see Him as the standard, and realize that as a follower of Jesus Christ, you have within you the very life of Christ.

286
00:49:46,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 And that the purpose of God in saving you was to glorify Himself by making you more and more like His Son.

287
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 And so the choice isn't between applying earthly wisdom or heavenly wisdom necessarily.

288
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 The choice is about living by the power of self, which will always go off course and follow the wisdom of this world.

289
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 Or will you live by the power of the Holy Spirit, which is the wisdom of God, and that will be displayed in your life continually.

290
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 Listen, if you're asking God for wisdom, and you are in an increasing way influenced by the Holy Spirit of God, then guess what?

291
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 You don't have to try to be pure and motive, and you don't have to try to be peaceful, and you don't have to try to be gentle, and you don't have to try to be open to reason.

292
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 You don't have to try to be full of mercy. You don't have to try to produce good fruit.

293
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 You don't have to try to be impartial and sincere. These things are going to flow out of you.

294
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 He's going to do it. And it's going to be evident and obvious.

295
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 So the wisdom that guides your life cannot be hidden.

296
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 So brothers and sisters, follow Christ, and let the world see your good works and glorify your God.

297
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 This is what James is getting at.

298
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Would you pray with me?

299
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Father, I thank you for the time we've had, and Lord, I pray that you would make this more clear in people's hearts and minds than I could ever in the time that I've had today.

300
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 I pray that you would move your people, that you would motivate your people to be led by the Spirit and not by the flesh.

301
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 Lord, as we are led by the Spirit, and we understand, and we know that these characteristics are produced in us and flow through us so that they become obvious to everyone, and thereby you alone are glorified.

302
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 And Father, I pray if there's one here today who's never trusted you as Lord and Savior, Lord, they are still enslaved, bound to live only according to the wisdom of this world.

303
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 I pray, Father, that you will help them to see and understand that there is another way, a way that produces godliness because there is wisdom that comes from you, and that is not to try harder, it's not to be religious, it's not to do religious things, and good things, but it is to trust in Christ alone as Lord and Savior.

304
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 So, Father, I pray that you would work in every heart and life.

305
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 With his bound and I's closed, no one looking around if you have never placed your faith in trust in Christ, listen, the thing that you need to be concerned about today is not by trying to live a better life so that you can have the good life.

306
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 The thing you need to be concerned about today is the fact that you are according to Scripture spiritually dead in your trespasses and sins, that you are captive to the wisdom of this world.

307
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 And that you right now are condemned by God.

308
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 That the only way that you can escape that condemnation, the only way that you can escape the enslavement to the wisdom of this world, the only hope you have is by placing all of your hope, all of your trust, all of your faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

309
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 He will cause you to be born again, he will give you new life, he will set you free from that which enslave you today.

310
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 He will make you a new creation.

311
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 He will give you the Holy Spirit who will enable you to live according not to the wisdom of this world but the wisdom of God.

312
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 When the service is over today, we are going to be down front, I am going to be down front.

313
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 If you have a question about being saved, I would love to answer any question you have.

314
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Please come and talk to me.

315
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 I would love to listen to you and help.

316
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 Father, I pray that you would guide and direct in these next few moments and ask it in Christ's name. Amen.
