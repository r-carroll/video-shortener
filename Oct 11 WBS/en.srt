00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Well, good evening. Nice to see all of you with us tonight. Take your copy of God's word.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,560
 Please find Ephesians chapter number five. And if you don't have a handout, if you do not have a

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,160
 handout, please make sure that you pick one up there at the table. Back in the back, you're going to

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,120
 want one just to follow along and keep up with what we're studying this evening. Let me read to

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,960
 you a pretty lengthy quote. It begins, to me, it seems that we are living in an important and

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,000
 uncertain age. And the institution of marriage is most assuredly in an uncertain state. If 50 to

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,280
 75% of Ford or General Motors cars completely fell apart within the early part of their lifetimes

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,840
 as automobiles, drastic steps would be taken. We have no such well organized way of dealing with our

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,120
 social institutions, so people are groping more or less blindly to find alternatives to marriage,

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,720
 which is certainly less than 50% successful, living together without marriage, living in communities,

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,360
 or communes, extensive childcare centers, serial monogamy with one divorce after another,

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,560
 and the woman's liberation movement to establish the woman as person in her own right,

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,680
 new divorce laws which do away with the concept of guilt. These are all gropings towards some new

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,560
 form of man-woman relationship for the future. It continues, it would take a bolder man than I to

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,960
 predict what will emerge. Dr. Carl Rogers wrote those words in 1973, but 1973 book,

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,760
 Becoming Partners Marriage and its Alternatives. And we've seen further decimation on the social

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,040
 landscape, and the church, unfortunately, has not been spared. Yet God's design, well, he designed

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,360
 it from the very beginning, remains the key to having what so many would refer to as a happy

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,040
 marriage, what so many are looking for in their own lives, a happy marriage. So you're in Ephesians

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 chapter number five, look with me at verse number 25 as we continue to work through the text that we

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,480
 began last week. God's word says, husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,040
 himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,360
 word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:33,840
 such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. Now last week we started working through

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,240
 section of Ephesians known by some as the household code or the house table, and I read to you a quote

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,080
 last week by Harold Horner, the theologian and the commentary writer, he said it is natural

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,440
 that any given society would adhere to specific rules for the order of life, politically,

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,800
 domestically, socially and religiously. It is also natural that since believers then and now

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,440
 are a part of society, they too need a code of conduct. The household code of Ephesians addresses

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,920
 this by advancing a distinctly Christian ethic. He continues under or Paul under God's direction

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,960
 to present distinctly Christian household codes to instruct believers in their conduct with one

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,400
 another and within the secular society. So before we really launch out any further into the study

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
 this evening, we need to understand that the instruction beginning in verse number 22 and working

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,680
 all the way through chapter 6 and verse number 9 is fully dependent upon the command issued in

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,080
 chapter 5 verse number 18, which is what? Be filled with the spirit or the the correct grammatical

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,680
 way of saying it might be be being filled with the spirit that we are continually putting ourselves

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,680
 in place to be influenced to a greater and greater degree by the Holy Spirit who lives within us.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,000
 And so we're not acting rogue, we're not living the way we want to live, we're not doing the things

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,040
 we want to do. No, instead we are allowing our lives to be influenced to a greater degree by the

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,040
 Holy Spirit who lives within us. And so one of the ways that we fill ourselves up or that we are

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,840
 filled up is of course by being in the Word of God, it's through prayer, it's through

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,280
 communing with other believers, it's through the common means of grace that God provides to us.

43
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,880
 And as we expose ourselves to those common means of grace, the idea is that the Holy Spirit gains

44
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,880
 greater control or greater influence over our lives. And so if we're going to live out the household

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,840
 code, we must certainly be filled with the Holy Spirit. And one of the truths that we cannot forget

46
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,200
 or neglect is that every action and every ethic that follows in the household code is fully

47
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,800
 dependent then upon the influence of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. In other words,

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,920
 you cannot follow these commands faithfully without being filled with the Spirit. The Holy Spirit

49
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:06,000
 is critical if there is any hope whatsoever of having a marriage and a home that continually

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,560
 reflects God's design for the marriage and the home. That includes parenting as well. And so as we

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,280
 launched into this section last week, I provided really the main point or the one thing that we need

52
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,320
 to grasp as we study and work through these verses in the household code. And I'll just reiterate

53
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,760
 to you again, we must recognize God's design and follow Christ. If we don't recognize God's design,

54
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,240
 then we will substitute God's design with man's wisdom. And that never works out very well.

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,960
 If we don't recognize God's design and if we don't follow Christ, we are headed to nothing

56
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,560
 really but heartache. We'll find ourselves down the road in marriage or in family life,

57
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,600
 scratching our head, wondering why things aren't working out the way they probably ought to work out.

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,640
 We'll wonder, you know, what's going on with our lives, what's going on with our marriage,

59
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,480
 and it really comes back to the reality that we did not recognize God's design and we did not

60
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,280
 follow Christ in living that out on a daily basis. And so Paul's first command given to us in

61
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,400
 verse number 22 was issued to Christian wives, specifically, who are then according to the word of

62
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,080
 God to submit to their own husbands as to the Lord. And so the imperative submit, and this is by

63
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,160
 way of review, is in the middle voice, meaning that every Christian woman is to subject herself

64
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:43,200
 or to submit herself to her husband. Now, somebody on our social media team last week decided to

65
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,080
 take a little clip of the Bible study and put it out there. And I don't know how people see these

66
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,080
 things necessarily. And they become pretty widespread and wide circulated. And it seems like,

67
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,560
 whenever I say anything about marriage and husband-wife relationships specifically, more people seem to

68
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,280
 watch those clips than just, you know, general teaching clips. I don't know why, but it happens.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,800
 And the comments absolutely crack me up because you're talking about a 10 second, you know, clip of a

70
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,400
 50-minute Bible study. And some of the things these people say, I don't even know how to explain it.

71
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,480
 I'm like, watch the whole sermon, watch the whole study, you know, it's there. I got called a

72
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,440
 heretic and everything else. It's hilarious, really. But what we need to realize here is that the

73
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,760
 language is important. The language that Paul uses is important. Why? Because Paul here, and again,

74
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,400
 this is to reiterate what we talked about last week. Paul is not calling for forced submission,

75
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,880
 where the husband requires his wife to obey him. Paul is not requiring a Christian wife to

76
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,680
 obey her husband in the same way that a child is to obey his or her parents. We'll see that in

77
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:13,840
 chapter 6, verse number 1. Paul was saying that God established an order in the Christian home

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:22,400
 in which the husband is to lead his wife, and his wife is to recognize and respond rightly

79
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,600
 to his role as the leader, as the provider, as the protector of the home.

80
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,920
 So this is explained with the illustration that Paul provided, verses 23 and 24. The husband is

81
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,880
 the head, simply means he ranks above or is the leader. He is not the source of the wife, even as

82
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,520
 Christ is the head of the church, his body. Now, beyond that, the Christian wife is to submit to

83
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,400
 her husband according to what Paul says in the same way that she submits to the Lord. And the

84
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,920
 implication here is simple. If the wife does not submit to the Lord, she will not submit to her

85
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:11,040
 husband. And conversely, if the wife does not submit to the husband, she will not submit to the Lord.

86
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,880
 They go hand in hand. So for a Christian wife, she must submit to her husband as she submits to

87
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,560
 the Lord. If she submits to the Lord, she'll submit to her husband. If she does not, she won't

88
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:35,280
 submit to her husband. And so God's design is good. God's design is right. God, the creator of

89
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,560
 all human beings knows what is required for human flourishing. Does he not? Of course he does.

90
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,600
 And so he orders these things in this way because this is how human beings flourish,

91
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,520
 man and woman in the covenant of marriage. This is how human beings flourish in the home,

92
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,600
 parents raising children. This is how human beings flourish in society, employers, employees.

93
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:11,440
 So beginning in verse number 25, Paul provides eight verses now of instruction directed to married

94
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:21,360
 Christian men. All right, so you have verses 22, 23, 24, three verses directed to Christian wives.

95
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,680
 You have eight verses directed to Christian men. I don't know if it's because men are

96
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,440
 more stubborn and hard-headed and so they need it kind of repeated over and over again. I'm not

97
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,120
 quite sure why the Holy Spirit would have moved him to provide so much instruction. Actually,

98
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,600
 there is a reason. I think we're going to get into that a little bit tonight. But the point

99
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:53,760
 of Paul in writing this to men is very simple and that is this. Love requires sacrifice. You

100
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:06,240
 want to write that down. Love requires sacrifice. So back in 1992, I was all of 18 years old back then.

101
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,120
 There was a group that I was not allowed to listen to because they were not on the approved list.

102
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,400
 They were called DC talk. I remember DC talk, decent Christian talk, DC talk. I think that's what

103
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,040
 it stood for. And I wasn't allowed to listen to it because they're hoodlums. But they released a

104
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:33,680
 song in 1992 entitled Love, L-U-V is a verb. Anybody remember that and want to admit it?

105
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,160
 All right, don't shlei. You're with me. Okay, absolutely. Love is a... Did I see Dan? You had

106
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,880
 your... Okay, good. All right, so there's a few of us in here that might remember that. Even though

107
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,280
 I wasn't allowed to listen to it, I might have snuck and listened to it a few times. It was a pretty

108
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:57,440
 popular song in Christian circles back then. And 20 some years later, John Mayer released a song,

109
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,760
 also entitled Love, he's spelled it L-O-V-E is a verb. And the lyrics he recorded, I think,

110
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,760
 are a little bit more articulate to the point. Here's some of the lyrics. Love is a verb. It ain't a thing.

111
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,160
 This is brilliant writing. It's not something you own. It's not something you scream. When you show

112
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,920
 me love, I don't need your words. Yeah, love ain't a thing. Love is a verb. Love ain't a thing. Love is

113
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:33,280
 a verb. I feel dumber for having a... My IQ just dropped 20 points. I don't know.

114
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,440
 Now, the point, and if you're a John Mayer fan, I'm sorry, the point of both songs is essentially

115
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,600
 the same. Love is not something you talk about. That real love is something that must be demonstrated.

116
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:59,920
 Real love is something that must be demonstrated. So Paul was not commanding in this text a man

117
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,720
 to have certain feelings toward his wife. He wasn't saying husbands feel lovingly towards your wife.

118
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:20,160
 Love is not first and foremost in emotion. Now, is love emotive? Certainly it is. But the kind of love

119
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,480
 that Paul is talking about here isn't an emotional love. The kind of love that Paul is talking about

120
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:36,960
 here is really something that must be done. It is an action, but it's not just any action. Love is

121
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:48,160
 an action that seeks out the highest good for the one who is loved. Specifically, a Christian man

122
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:59,840
 who loves his wife always, please listen to this, always does, that which is best for her,

123
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:08,160
 that which is in her best interest even at great cost to himself.

124
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:22,720
 And so Paul used the word agapeo, which is translated love six times in his instruction to Christian

125
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:31,200
 husbands. Meaning that because of the repetition, we can see that this is a key word in this section.

126
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,840
 It's something that Paul wanted us to see. It's something that Paul wanted us to understand.

127
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,520
 And the meaning behind the word is that we would have great affection, men we would have great

128
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:57,440
 affection for our wife, irrespective of merit, even toward those who are undeserving.

129
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,640
 So let me put it this way. It means that you love unconditionally. And because you love

130
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,800
 unconditionally, a function of that is that you continually seek the highest good for the one

131
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,640
 who is loved. Again, Honour wrote, this is similar to the instruction for the wife. Her submission is

132
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,320
 not dependent upon her husband's response. Likewise, a husband's love is not dependent on his wife's

133
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,960
 response, neither are governed by the variegues of emotion rather by an act of the will.

134
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,400
 This is not to say that love is an act of the will entirely devoid of any emotions,

135
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:46,000
 but rather if based entirely on emotions, the husband's love would be based only on a good response.

136
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:56,240
 In other words, if you please me, then I'll love you. If you take care of me, then I'll love you.

137
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,400
 One of the things that we tell young couples in Primeral Counseling is that the love that you have,

138
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 specifically husband for your bride to be, cannot be just an emotional love. It must be more than that.

139
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,920
 It must be a commitment to love, which in and of itself is then an action to love her. I'm choosing

140
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,040
 to love you continually, no matter what you do. Whether you please me or don't please me.

141
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,520
 Now, we need to understand that this teaching was at the time it was originally given entirely

142
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:39,680
 countercultural. Can you imagine being among the first people to hear this? This ethic?

143
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,880
 Totally unique, totally different, totally outside of that which was normal in society at that time.

144
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,080
 And so there were the believers in Ephesus sitting there and the letter was given to him and it's

145
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,240
 unrolled and they begin to read it and they come across husbands love your wives as Christ

146
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,920
 love the church and they were probably sitting there going, well, what exactly does that mean?

147
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,720
 It doesn't make a lot of sense. And not much has changed because Paul's instruction is just as

148
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:21,680
 countercultural today. Most people think in terms of what I can get out of something, not what I can

149
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,800
 give someone. They use love as a means to secure that which they long for, not as a motivation to

150
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:35,600
 give themselves for the highest good of someone else. And so our culture values a love that costs

151
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,080
 nothing. Our culture values a love that doesn't carry with it any real commitment. There is no real

152
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:50,800
 sacrifice. There is no real expenditure of resources. We think of love in terms of nothing to lose,

153
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:58,720
 but everything to gain. Now why do we think that way about love? Well, I believe one reason is

154
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,480
 because that's the kind of love to which we are constantly exposed. Tozer wrote, millions of young

155
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,920
 people today are wholly unable to think of love except in terms of the disgraceful promiscuity of

156
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,440
 Hollywood newspapers. Now report the numerous marriages of the movie crowd by number. It was the

157
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,240
 third marriage for her, his fourth. And if it were not so tragic for everyone concerned, it would be

158
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,520
 hugely comical to read of a movie star being interviewed by the press and solemnly assuring the

159
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,560
 public that she is not at the moment in love. Such a use of the word is completely degraded and

160
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,000
 smacks more of the beasts than of men made in the image of God. For the millions love is an

161
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,160
 emotional attraction, nothing more as unstable and as unpredictable as sheet lightning. The Bible

162
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,240
 teaches on the contrary that true love is a benevolent principle and is under the control of the will.

163
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,800
 Tozer also wrote this, no law has ever been passed that can compel one moral being to love another

164
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,600
 for by the very nature of it. Love must be voluntary. No one can be coerced or frightened into

165
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:15,040
 loving anyone. And so, biblically speaking, love is an act of the will.

166
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:24,480
 That is given with the knowledge that it will in fact cost you something.

167
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,680
 This is one of the mistakes that I see young couples make in the early days of the marriage because

168
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,720
 they don't understand that love actually cost you something. And so, some guys, guys mature slower

169
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,880
 than girls, right? For the most part, some guys they want to get married and have a wife,

170
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,560
 but then they want to keep all their friends and they want to keep their old schedule and they

171
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,000
 want to do all the things that they always did before they were married and that doesn't work.

172
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,680
 You have to give up something for the one you love.

173
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,840
 And so, this instruction to men is significant. And let me tell you why. I think it's because

174
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,760
 men tend to be selfish creatures. We don't want to give of ourselves. We don't want

175
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,760
 others or we want others to give of themselves to us. We don't want to sacrifice. We don't want

176
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,280
 to do without. We don't want to inconvenience ourselves for the good of others. Yet the biblical

177
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:36,240
 standard provided by Paul in this text is selfless, sacrificing love. And this is the work that

178
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,680
 God gives to Christian husbands. And so, love requires sacrifice. And tonight, what I hope

179
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,960
 happens is that you will have a greater appreciation for this passage and what it means when it is

180
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,520
 applied faithfully and consistently to your life. So, men who are married, this is directly

181
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,360
 pointing at you. It's the Holy Spirit of God who super-intended the writing of this passage

182
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,120
 that is pointing it right at you. Ladies, this is not for you to sit there with your husband

183
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,880
 and elbow him all night. All right? It's good for you to understand what his role is and how you are

184
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,080
 to be loved. But you are not his Holy Spirit who can make him love you the way that the Bible says

185
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,920
 that he is to love you. And if that's your goal in hearing this tonight and you want to sit

186
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:38,240
 there and make the rib of your spouse sore, then you are stepping outside of God's means and God's

187
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,680
 role for you this evening. Let the Holy Spirit work in the heart and life of your husband,

188
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 not you, you're not the Holy Spirit. Amen? Okay, good. And for those of you who aren't married,

189
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,680
 hey, this is really good young men for you to hold on to and understand and realize because

190
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,320
 one of these days, God willing, you will be married if that's his plan for your life. And young

191
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,800
 ladies, as you're considering a man to marry, you want to understand how he is supposed to love you

192
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,280
 so that you don't choose poorly and then live with the regret of that for the rest of your life.

193
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,000
 So it really does apply to everybody in the room tonight. But as we get into this, how does the

194
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,880
 Apostle Paul reveal to the Ephesian believers that love require sacrifice? There is one point to

195
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,080
 this lesson this evening. All right, normally there's at least two. There's one and one only and

196
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:43,360
 that is this. The Christian husband must follow the example of Christ. Straight forward, right?

197
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:53,040
 The Christian husband must follow the example of Christ. Paul begins husbands. A husband is a man

198
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,920
 who has entered the covenant of marriage with a woman who is his wife and the instruction is that

199
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 the Christian husband here is to then to make a habit of engaging his will to demonstrate love to

200
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,600
 his wife in real intangible ways. Husbands love, that word love is a present-active imperative verb.

201
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,640
 The imperative is a command. Present tense, it means it's habitual. It's the ongoing reality of

202
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,880
 your life that you are known then by yourself and by your spouse for your love, your consistent love,

203
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,760
 your consistent demonstration of love. It's just the way you live your life. It's an active meaning

204
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,240
 that this isn't something passive that is being put up on you, but this is something that you actually

205
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:46,800
 engage your will volitionally to accomplish. Husbands love your wife. Now, the love that Paul is

206
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:55,360
 commanding to believing husbands is restricted to who, your wife. So what is Paul doing here? He's

207
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,760
 using a reflexive pronoun to function as a possessive pronoun. Now, what exactly does that mean?

208
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,360
 It means this. The Paul was instructing a Christian husband to direct this kind of love.

209
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,840
 The kind of love that he's going to clarify in just a few moments to direct this kind of love

210
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:23,120
 exclusively to his own wife and not another woman. Husbands, this kind of love belongs to one

211
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,600
 woman only, and that is the wife that God has given you. You do not have a right to give this

212
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:41,120
 kind of love to a woman who is not your wife. Period. Paul is in a way here teaching monogamy.

213
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,800
 It is to your wife, the one to whom you have coveted your life.

214
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,640
 Historically, this teaching was unique because something like this is not found in the Old Testament,

215
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,680
 this command to love your wife. It's not found in the Old Testament. It's not found in rabbinic literature.

216
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,600
 It's not found in the household codes of the Greco-Roman era, but here is something else to consider.

217
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:21,840
 Paul here noticed does not command husbands to rule over their wives. The command is husbands love

218
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:30,800
 your wives. Not husbands rule your wife. Husbands subject your wife to yourself.

219
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,400
 Instead, husbands are urged repeatedly to love their wives. I hope you can see that. It's right there

220
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:48,800
 in the text. Paul actually reinforced this command two times in this section. He does so in

221
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:56,320
 verse number 28 in the same way. Husbands should love their wives. He does again in verse number 33,

222
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,120
 let each of you love his wife as himself. Then he gives the command also to believing men

223
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,080
 in the church of Colossae. Husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them. Now what?

224
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,920
 In the world does that teach us? Well, simple. This teaching is extremely important.

225
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,360
 And because it's extremely important, it should not be overlooked. It should not be ignored. In fact,

226
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,840
 if you ignore this teaching, you do so to your own hurt and to the detriment of your marriage and

227
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:40,400
 your family. So believers, grab on to this. This is no small thing. In fact, I can tell you from

228
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:48,400
 experience that when marriages begin to suffer and when they are strained, the issue responsible

229
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:56,560
 for creating the most tension is when the husband fails to love the wife that God has given him

230
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:05,520
 as prescribed in this text. I'm not saying that the fault for marriage difficulties is 100% on the

231
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,840
 men. I'm saying that in my experience, what I have seen time and time again is men not living up to

232
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,800
 this, which then causes a whole lot of other things to break down.

233
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,360
 So as you look at this, fellas, you need to see this as a giant sign with flashing lights dancing

234
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:38,080
 around the edges to grab your attention. You must, at all times, exercise your will to love

235
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:50,640
 the wife that God has given you. No excuses. Period. This means that you don't get to refrain from

236
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 loving your wife because she's difficult. This means you don't get to refrain from loving your

237
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,320
 wife because she's demanding. This means that you don't get to refrain from loving your wife because

238
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,120
 she's annoying. This means that you don't get to refrain from loving your wife because she's

239
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:21,120
 high maintenance. This means that loving your wife is not optional. Loving your wife is your

240
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:36,080
 responsibility. It is your duty. It is required before God. Husbands, love at all times your wife.

241
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,080
 Okay, we're done. Good, right? No. Because the question now is what does that love look like? I mean,

242
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,760
 we've called it looking out for the highest good of the one being loved and we've used that kind of

243
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:03,200
 language at this point. But what exactly does that kind of love look like? Well, Paul, as he's

244
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,960
 prone to do, provided for their explanation and he even gave us an illustration so that we can

245
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,880
 know beyond any shadow of doubt exactly what he had in mind when he wrote husbands love your

246
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:28,400
 wives. Now, look at what comes next. As Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.

247
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,440
 Okay, so now the picture that may have been just a little fuzzy is starting to come into focus,

248
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 right? The word translated as in the text is actually a comparative conjunction. It means that

249
00:29:49,440 --> 00:30:01,920
 every man, every Christian man who is married, not follow this, should compare how he loves his wife

250
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:19,360
 to how Christ loved the church. That's the standard. That means that the standard isn't other men in the

251
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:28,000
 church. So guys, don't look at other guys in the church who treat their wives like garbage and say,

252
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 well, honey, you're lucky to have me because at least I'm not him. Okay, because that's not the standard.

253
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:50,160
 It also means that the standard isn't culture and society. What culture and society calls love,

254
00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:00,320
 what culture and society puts a spotlight on it says this is what love should be. This is the way a

255
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:08,560
 man should love his wife. No, culture and society isn't the standard. It's not the thing that we measure

256
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:26,240
 by. According to Paul, the standard is Christ. Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church,

257
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,000
 compare how you are actively loving your wife to how Christ loved the church.

258
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:40,720
 One commentator noted the modeling ground of the husband's love for his wife are Christ's love for

259
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,600
 the church, the character and description of that love are amplified in the following clause and

260
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:54,720
 gave himself up for her. So it's one thing to say, well, the husband's love your wives as Christ

261
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,040
 loved the church. Okay, then we would be sitting here scratching our heads once again saying, okay,

262
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,280
 what does that mean? How did Christ love the church? What are we looking for specifically? Well,

263
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,160
 the next clause tells us what we are looking for specifically because it reveals how Christ loved

264
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:21,040
 the church and gave himself up for her. Now, we've seen this language before in Ephesians, right?

265
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,480
 Back in chapter 5, verse number 2, and walk in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up

266
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,320
 for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. Now, what was Paul doing in both instances? He was

267
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:42,000
 telling us Christian men specifically to look to Christ so that we might see and understand

268
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,560
 how to live out this instruction. In other words, if you want to know what it looks like to walk

269
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:58,000
 in love, if you want to know what it looks like to love your wife as Christ loved the church,

270
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,960
 look to Christ and you'll see the example to follow. Now, if you're wondering at this point,

271
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,720
 how is that possible? Jesus wasn't even married. You're missing Paul's point.

272
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,800
 Paul's point was for us to see the example of selflessness, the example of sacrifice that

273
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,760
 loved demands by looking at Jesus' selflessness and sacrifice for the church. In other words,

274
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,440
 Jesus showed us a truth that was established earlier in the study. Those who love give themselves

275
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:48,880
 for those they love. Those who love give themselves for those they love. This means, very simply put,

276
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:56,080
 that love, biblically speaking, the kind of love that a Christian man is to give to his wife,

277
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:11,760
 love is never selfish. In other words, fellas, it's not about you. It's not about what you want. It's

278
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:25,360
 not about what you demand. And I'll take it a step further, that the love required

279
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 bisc rupture of a Christian husband for his wife following the example of Christ is always,

280
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:46,000
 always without fail, concerned with the highest good for the one he loves.

281
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,320
 And once again, we see that the language Paul used in this text is extremely important. Why?

282
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:08,480
 Because it's extremely revealing. Notice Christ gave himself. Now the word translated gave means

283
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:19,760
 to hand over. It means to give over to someone or something. What it means in relation to this text

284
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:27,840
 is that Jesus wasn't taken to the cross, but he gave himself into the hands of the Roman soldiers

285
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:36,640
 who nailed him to the cross. You see, yeah, but you know, he walked the Via del Rosa and he carried the

286
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,840
 cross and then he couldn't carry it any longer and Simon did it. And so they took him up to

287
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,200
 Galgotha. They took him up to the place of his crucifixion. Listen, if he did not want to go,

288
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,120
 there aren't enough people on the planet who could have moved him a single solitary cinemator.

289
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
 Pilate said, you're going to talk to me this way, don't you know I have the power to take your life

290
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,960
 from you? And Jesus said, you have got no power over me except that which I give to you.

291
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:18,720
 Christ gave himself. This is what Jesus meant when he said, I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd

292
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,200
 lays down his life for the sheep. He was telling the disciples, right there, I'm going to lay down

293
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:34,160
 my life for you. John 10, 15, just as the father knows me and I know the father and I lay down

294
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:43,520
 my life for the sheep. Verse 17 and 18, John 10, for this reason the father loves me because I lay

295
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:51,200
 down my life that I may take it up again. Look at verse 18, no one takes it from me, but I lay it

296
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,600
 down on my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again.

297
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,880
 This charge I've received from my father, John 15, 13, greater man has no love than this, that

298
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,840
 someone lay down voluntarily again and act of will his life for his friends.

299
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,560
 And so as we're considering this text, please don't miss the pronoun here himself,

300
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,800
 because Paul wanted his readers to know that Jesus was not forced to die.

301
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:33,040
 He did so willingly. He prayed in the garden, what, not my will,

302
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,000
 vine be done, but he was obedient and to death, even death at the cross.

303
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,760
 I'd go so far as to say this, if Jesus didn't give up his life, he would have never died.

304
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,040
 But he gave up himself on behalf of or for the sake of the church.

305
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:06,240
 And this is outstanding when you think about it, because who in this room is worthy of such a sacrifice?

306
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:22,480
 I'm not. You're not. There's never been a human being who's walked this earth who is worthy of

307
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:34,000
 that kind of sacrifice. Paul says in Romans chapter 5, but God shows His love for us in that while we

308
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,720
 were yet sinners, Christ died for us. He didn't die for good people. He didn't die for clean people.

309
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:53,440
 He didn't die for worthy people. While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. He died for the

310
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:01,680
 ungodly. And this truth helps us further understand that a Christian husband is to love his wife,

311
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:12,640
 sacrifice, sacrificial unconditionally, selflessly, without regard to the personality or behavior of his wife.

312
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,160
 But why did Jesus love the church so much? What was Jesus' goal in giving himself up for her? Well,

313
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,120
 the answer to that question is found in three-purpose clauses in verses 26 and 27. You've heard me

314
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:34,960
 talking about Hina clauses before. You typically see a Hina clause whenever you have the English word

315
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,600
 that. So you see it, the first part of verse 26, that's the Greek word Hina, that he might sanctify

316
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:48,960
 her, drop down to verse 27. So that, again, another Hina clause, he might present the church to himself,

317
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,440
 drop down to verse number, the last part of verse 27, that she might be holy without blemish.

318
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,200
 There's the three-purpose clauses. This was the goal. This is what Jesus had in mind

319
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,480
 when he gave himself up, willingly, voluntarily, compelled by love to do so and give his life on the

320
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:22,960
 cross. First is that he might sanctify her. You know, Jesus loved the church and he gave himself over

321
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:32,160
 to be crucified because he desired to sanctify or set the church apart to himself.

322
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,000
 Now, a lot of times when you talk about salvation language, you talk about satiriology, you'll talk

323
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,400
 about justification, which is the initial act of salvation whereby we are cleansed, we are made

324
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,520
 righteous and holy before a righteous and holy God. The very righteousness of Christ is imputed

325
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,800
 to us and it becomes our righteousness and so that's justification. It can also be referred to as

326
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:10,480
 positional sanctification, meaning that we are in salvation then set apart unto God as his people,

327
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,920
 his possession. And we see that in the word saints. Back in chapter 1, verse number 1, Paul is

328
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,440
 writing and he says to the saints, the idea of a saint is one who is set apart distinct.

329
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:33,760
 And so in verse number 26, that he might sanctify it, what, that he might set her apart to himself,

330
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,640
 that he claims her as his very own, meaning the church. And the next phrase then reveals how it's

331
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,520
 possible to be positionally sanctified or to set apart as the holy people of God.

332
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:57,200
 Having cleansed her, we've been cleansed by, from all of our sin so that we could then be accepted

333
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,960
 by a holy God and then we see the means by which we are cleansed by the washing of water with the

334
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,200
 word. Now, I want to make this extremely clear. Paul is not saying that sin can be washed away

335
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:20,080
 by water baptism. Not what he's getting at, that's not his point. Christian baptism by immersion is

336
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:31,120
 only symbolic, it is not effectual. Baptism does not cleanse anyone from sin. So to what was Paul

337
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,760
 referring here, I believe he was referring to the cleansing that is accomplished by Christ, the

338
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,280
 washing of regeneration that Paul described in Titus 35, which is a spiritual cleansing of all sin,

339
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,320
 which is only accomplished when a person puts all of their faith, all of their hope, all of their

340
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:52,400
 trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. So it's best to understand this as a word picture.

341
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,120
 The Paul wanted his readers to understand the cleansing they received through faith in Christ,

342
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:07,200
 like being washed with water so that dirt is removed. Paul might also have wanted to evoke

343
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,520
 images of bridal bath and marital imagery used in Ezekiel, chapter 16, verses 8 through 14. One

344
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,560
 commentator described it this way, the language of the washing with water may well have a secondary

345
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,560
 reference to the bridal bath when Yahweh entered his marriage covenant with Jerusalem. He bathed her

346
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,160
 with water, washed off the blood from her, anointed her with oil, clothed her with magnificent garments,

347
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,520
 making her so beautiful that she was fit to be a queen. Christ's death on behalf of the church

348
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,680
 was to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water. And this is analogous to the bride

349
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:49,200
 old bath. And this washing according to Paul is done in conjunction with the word, meaning the

350
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,760
 gospel message as it is preached and believed it is the instrument that brings people to faith

351
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,120
 in Christ. Romans, in Romans, Paul says it like this, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the

352
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:09,360
 word of Christ. And so Jesus' goal in giving himself up for the church was the positional sanctification

353
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:17,120
 or the justification of the church, but Paul is another motivation that he might present

354
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:27,200
 the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. So the second

355
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:36,080
 purpose clause is actually built on the first. We were set apart to Christ so that he could present

356
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:44,480
 to himself a glorious church. Now folks, you got to see this, Jesus does not let us prepare ourselves.

357
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:54,000
 But he prepares us by making us more and more like himself and then he presents us to himself

358
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,320
 as glorious or in splendor which means without any spot or wrinkle anything that defiles in any way.

359
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,240
 Honour's description is helpful here in brief then Christ prepares redemption and sanctification

360
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:15,440
 the bride, the church, with the purpose that he might present her to himself in the character of

361
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,640
 gloriousness. It is he himself who prepares her, he alone presents her and he alone receives her

362
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:33,440
 all glorious. And then the final purpose statement is that she might be holy and without blemish.

363
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:42,480
 In the Greek text there's a logical contrastive conjunction here that for whatever reason

364
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,640
 didn't make it into the SV. I don't know why, but it would typically be translated but.

365
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,720
 So we could read it so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or

366
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:06,000
 wrinkle or any such thing but that she might be holy and without blemish. The idea is that the church

367
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,240
 will not be tainted in any way. Now the question would be, and it's a logical question to come to

368
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:25,040
 at this point, when will the church be presented without blemish? I don't think Paul is using a

369
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,080
 realized eschatology here meaning he's not referring to the church as it is currently. Think about it,

370
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:40,160
 is the church today without blemish or wrinkle? I've been around churches way too long to know

371
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,640
 that there is no church that is without blemish or wrinkle. We are all still working through this

372
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,840
 process of sanctification and so we still daily struggle with sin and since the church is made

373
00:46:51,840 --> 00:47:04,800
 up of believers then this cannot be describing the church today. Why? Because the church is not

374
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,720
 itself undefiled right now or untainted positionally. Yes, practically. Nope.

375
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,320
 And so when we think, okay, is this talking about the church now? I think we all have to answer

376
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:28,320
 no because we all know ourselves far too well. But the time is coming when what we are positionally

377
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:38,160
 is what we will be practically. When the justification we have received leads to ongoing

378
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,600
 sanctification, that sanctification will be complete and we are glorified and then Christ will

379
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:56,640
 present His bride to Himself. Holy without blemish, in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any

380
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:05,760
 such thing. This will happen in the future when Christ comes again to claim His bride. Now listen

381
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,880
 to how one commentator wrote about this, not even the smallest spot or pucker that spoils the

382
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,120
 smoothness of the skin will mar the unsurpassed beauty of Christ's bride when he presents her to

383
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,760
 Himself. Heres will be a splendor that is exquisite, unsurpassed, matchless. For the present,

384
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,160
 the church on earth is often in rags and tatter stained and ugly despised and rejected.

385
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,720
 Christ's people may rightly be accused of many shortcomings and failures, but God's gracious

386
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,960
 intention is that the church should be holy and blameless. Language which speaks of a beauty,

387
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,280
 which is moral and spiritual. Both words have already appeared in Ephesians. The purpose of God's

388
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,000
 election of believers from before the foundation of the world is that they should be holy and

389
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,880
 blameless before Him, chapter 1, verse 4. They have also been used in collotions of the eschatological

390
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:04,320
 presentation of believers before God at the parasyah in collotions, chapter 1, verse 22, holiness

391
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:09,360
 and blamelessness will characterize Christ's bride, the church on that glorious day.

392
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:19,120
 So husband, love your wives as Christ, love the church and gave Himself up for her to accomplish

393
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,000
 what goal, what task that He might sanctify her, that He might present the church to Himself,

394
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,480
 that she might be holy and without blameless. We've seen the command, husband, love your wives,

395
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,960
 we've seen the illustration as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. We've seen

396
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:50,400
 the goal that He might sanctify her. But how in the world does this illustration that Paul

397
00:49:51,440 --> 00:50:01,520
 has provided here? And the goal that He spelled out for us, for us of Christ and His sacrifice for

398
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:16,880
 the church, how does all of this show us what Godly love looks like? How does it connect? How do we

399
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,960
 tie this up? Let's walk through it one last time, not the entire lesson, don't freak out, okay?

400
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:35,680
 Listen, our need was salvation and we were helpless to do anything about it. We could not cleanse

401
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:44,480
 ourselves of the sin that condemned us before righteous and holy God. We could not present ourselves

402
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:51,680
 to Him in any condition that He could and would accept. We were moral lepers, we were spiritually

403
00:50:51,760 --> 00:51:01,120
 dead in bankrupt. We could not make ourselves glorious, we could not remove the spots, we could not

404
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:11,360
 remove the wrinkles, we could not remove the blemishes caused by our sin. But Jesus driven by

405
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:18,960
 authentic love put aside His own well-being and gave Himself up to meet our need.

406
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,720
 That's how it connects. Real love is something that must be demonstrated.

407
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:39,520
 And what Paul does in this text is he demonstrates the love of Christ and that He willingly

408
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:52,240
 gave Himself sacrificially and unselfishly so that our greatest need would be met.

409
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:06,800
 He was the only one who could do it. And so husbands, in the same way, love your wife by giving

410
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:16,880
 yourself willingly, sacrificially and unselfishly to meet her needs.

411
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:29,280
 See, well, how in the world do I know what my wife's needs are? Well, you can get to know your wife

412
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:38,080
 by studying her. Peter gives this instruction, husbands live with your wives in an understanding way,

413
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,600
 showing honor to the woman. What does it mean? Live with your wives in an understanding way.

414
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,800
 It simply means this, that you take the time, gentlemen, to study your wife,

415
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:04,880
 to get to know her, to understand what the certain looks mean.

416
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:14,720
 And the certain sounds, certain tones,

417
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:28,080
 you don't pick up those things casually. They don't come to you by osmosis.

418
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:37,680
 It takes time. It takes communication. It takes sensitivity.

419
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,280
 It takes caring about her more than you care about yourself,

420
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,920
 so that you have the uncomfortable conversations.

421
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:57,680
 And that you listen instead of trying to talk and fix.

422
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,120
 And over a period of time, you come to know your wife.

423
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,000
 And you come to know, okay, what is it that she really needs right now?

424
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,640
 Versus what is it that she actually just wants right now?

425
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,080
 Because we all have needs. We all have wants.

426
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,200
 Sometimes it's not even clear. Rebecca and I have been married 27 over 27 years.

427
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,480
 And sometimes it's not even clear, so I have to stop her and say, okay, what is it that you need

428
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,240
 for me right now? Do you need me to listen or do you need me to fix something?

429
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,640
 I just need you to listen. Okay, fine. Do you need me to offer advice? Nope. Okay.

430
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,040
 That was really hard for me because I'd like give advice for a living, right?

431
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,640
 And so she'll start talking about things at work and I'm like, well, if it was me,

432
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,040
 I would do and she'll just look at me. Like, okay, yeah, I'll just,

433
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,840
 what you need for me right now is just to listen.

434
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,880
 Dwell with her. Live with your wives in an understanding way. It means be sensitive and thoughtful

435
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,840
 to her needs. Communicate with her and do everything you can to honor her.

436
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,160
 Put her interests before your own.

437
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,640
 And you do without so that she has what she needs.

438
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,680
 You think of her before you think of yourself.

439
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,920
 There may be times in your life and marriage where you're called upon to do for her what she

440
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,680
 cannot do for herself and maybe it will come at great personal cost to you.

441
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,200
 Maybe the time will come where you'll have to stand up to defend or protect her

442
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,200
 and you'll lose your life to save hers.

443
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,600
 This is what we do.

444
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,120
 This is what love lived out looks like.

445
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:11,200
 I said at the beginning love is truly a verb and by God's design a Christian husband

446
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,920
 is to love his wife and give himself up for her.

447
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:26,400
 And the illustration of Christ here is so that we can see what that love was that Jesus did

448
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,640
 for us what we could never do for ourselves and he gave himself up to accomplish it.

449
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,400
 And if you want more scripture to back that up just go read Ephesians 2

450
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,880
 1 through 11 specifically 5 through 11 and you'll see it right there.

451
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,240
 The Paul says have this mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

452
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,040
 And this is one of the keys to a happy home.

453
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:07,600
 And this is the responsibility men that God has placed upon us and it's a joyous privilege

454
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,240
 to love your wife this way.

455
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,320
 I wish I could stand before you tonight and say you know what I have figured this one out.

456
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,880
 I'm really really really good at it and I succeed more than I fail.

457
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,800
 I have to fight my flesh daily.

458
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,480
 And I've got a wife who's easy to love.

459
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,560
 And still it's a fight.

460
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,800
 But it's a fight that you must fight.

461
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,960
 If your home is going to be what God has intended it to be.

462
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,000
 So let's pray. Father thank you for our time together.

463
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,400
 Thank you that we were able to spend these moments in your word.

464
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,960
 God I pray that the instruction that you have given

465
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,960
 through the apostle to us is not something that we dismiss,

466
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,240
 that we take lightly, but Father that we might see it as vital

467
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,800
 to having the kind of home that you have desired for us to have, that you have designed.

468
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:17,760
 So God I pray that we would put aside as men put aside ourselves

469
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,920
 and the needs that we so cling to

470
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,760
 and love our wives willingly, selfishly, sacrificially,

471
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:38,880
 that we might reflect to a lost world the love of Christ for the Church.

472
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,880
 And let us rejoice tonight, Father, in remembering

473
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,120
 what Christ did for us.

474
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,480
 It's not coincidence and it's not to be overlooked that Paul used the sacrifice of the sun

475
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,720
 to drive this point home to us so that we might remember once again

476
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,480
 what Jesus did for us. And that we have life

477
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,360
 because of his life and death and resurrection.

478
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,400
 And so Father we rejoice and we praise you and thank you for your goodness to us.

479
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,400
 We ask you Lord to bless in Jesus' name, amen.
