early 60 or early 70s I suppose it was a guy from Southern California and met a girl from northeastern Ohio in Greenville South Carolina they dated for a little while they got married graduated from college and then went to Wichita Kansas and Adam Ministry there for a few years and it was during that Ministry during that time in their lives that God to get into it to impress upon them the burden them to plant a church and they wondered where they should plan to church not a trip to see her parents in Northeast Ohio that they came through Columbus area and they said this would be a great place to plant a church in so they began to think and pray about what it is that God would have them to do and they settled in on on a suburb and north of Columbus in this area and then finally God directed them here to Westerville and they planned it at church and on April 25th 1976 this church was born was birthed came to life and it was really a labor of Faith back then nowadays when people start churches in and I'm not saying that it's any easier to start churches nowadays but but now it is when people start church is typically they have a lot of financial support to help them don't have thousands and thousands of dollars from church planting organizations whether it be North American Mission board or converge or Acts 29 whatever it might be they have thousands upon thousands of dollars to help with initial cost setup costs things like that lot of times the pastor who is planting the church and their team Delray's financial support from other churches so that it helps offset the costs so they don't have to work necessarily a full-time job but they can give all of their energy and all of their effort to to planting a church and end the be paid for it through the support of a partner in churches and I think that's a wonderful thing I think that's a wonderful way to do it I'm thankful for that model but back then it wasn't that way the church planting family really didn't know how they were go to make ends meet the church itself had no money to speak of their weren't enormous Financial gifts given to help plant the church and so they they stepped out in faith and they they did this in and in faith they had their first service in faith they moved and merge with another church down off Morris Road in faith they bought this property when Cleveland Avenue was really nothing but a country road right two lanes and we can hardly even conceive of what it was back then for those of us who were who haven't been there or weren't there at that time but they just had faith and they bought this property not knowing how they were going to buy it not knowing this really how they were going to pay for it they built this building not knowing how they were going to do that they took on missionaries when the church was in its infancy and they had no idea how they were going to continue to support financially these missionaries but one by one they added missionaries to the missions family and continue to support them and I'm saying all of that was done because they believed that God would have a church planted here they believe that there was a need for a church not just then but going into the future that would boldly proclaim the truth of God's word and not back down to cultural whims and demands of a secular society they believe that God would use this church as a lighthouse in this place to make sure that people who are living in darkness might be exposed to the light and the truth of God's word it was all by faith last year the leadership of the church asked you who are members and regularly attend the church to buy Faith support something we call the One Vision campaign to say listen to We we by faith God has brought us to the place where we are but we need to look ahead to what God would have for us to do next and how best to prepare this church and the facilities that he's entrusted to us to to reach not just this generation but future Generations so that we might connect them through the gospel to Jesus Christ and so many of you jumped in and and you said okay by faith we're going to support this if I paid we're going to give in and by faith we're going to move forward and and you have been faithful in your commitment to that and for that I just want to command those of you who have been part of that campaign but we're a year into it now and so we were like when in the world are you ever going to turn over some dirt around here right we're working on it we're working on it and by God's grace and if everything goes the way we hope it will go we hope and pray that right after Jonathan O'Brien's wedding we will be turning over some dirt and building some things and and and remodeling and and reimagining parts of the building to to make sure that their expanded to reach more children to teach for children to make more disciples about children and adults alike throughout this campus and adding on to the existing facilities to meet the needs that we have today but also prepare us for the future and we're doing it by faith or doing it by faith so when it comes to face you'll never really find a clearly defined definition of faith in Scripture the text that we're going to this morning many people look at it as though it is a definition it says this is what faith is but as we work through the text this morning I plan on showing you that this isn't necessarily what faith is but this is what faith does find me a copy of God's word this morning please Hebrews chapter number 11 Hebrews chapter 11 there are numerous passages in God's word that tell us what faith does and I think that this place is probably very familiar to those of us who have been in church for any length of time if you're relatively new to church if you're relatively new to the faith than this is something that you might here refer to every once in awhile as God's Hall of Faith the passage of scripture in which God starts out by revealing to us I believe what faith does and then how that faith is played out or how it was played out how was lived out in the lives of his Saints through Old Testament times and even into today and I think that it's important to talk about this I think it's important to just start this series forward by faith because as we move closer and closer to the breaking of ground of the One Vision initiative we need as God's people to be reminded of the role that faith is supposed to have in our lives personally but also that we need to be reminded of the role that faith is to have in our lives corporately in the life of CrossPointe Church Hebrews was written by a man we don't know course all scripture is given by inspiration of God so God is the Divine author of this book but we don't know the human authors that he used to paint it some people believe it was Paul others believe it was a Polish there's a case made that Luke wrote this the reality is we don't know because God didn't reveal it to us it doesn't say in the beginning of Hebrews who wrote this book and there's really no clue throughout the letter who was the human author and I guess it doesn't really matter why because it's divinely inspired by God anyway and it's for our good to look with me if you wouldn't Hebrews chapter number 11 beginning and verse number one will look and worked on pack today 3 versus God's word says now Faith is the Assurance of things hoped for the conviction of Things Not Seen or buy it the people of old received their Commendation by faith we understand that the Universe was created by the word of God so that what is seen was not made out of things that are invisible when we look at this passage and when we think of it and its overall context that the message that we need to pull from this the thing we need to understand is this one simple truth that every believer must live by faith has made it possible for every believer to live by faith so that every believer can live by faith but I don't want to word it that way because I think it's necessary that we understand that it's not just a suggestion that Believers live by faith but it's it's really an imperative that Believers must live by faith that don't we as the people of God are called by God to live by faith that we begin to understand that a little bit as we think about the situation the circumstance that brought about this letter Hebrews this letter was written to a group of Jewish believers who heard the truth of the Gospel who heard that the Jesus Christ is the Messiah the promised Messiah the one for whom they were all waiting the one and that they were anticipating to come and so Jesus they believe that Jesus is this Messiah who lived who suffered on the cross for our sins as our substitute who died was buried who rose again who ascended and who is coming to get again it's all these these Hebrews these Jewish people heard this message their eyes were open that the faith to believe was imparted to them so that they placed their faith and trust in Jesus Christ Alone not their works not in their keeping of the law and so they in placing their faith and trust in Christ they move from this belief in the old Covenant as the the means of Salvation to the Fulfillment of the old Covenant which is Jesus alone and they Place their faith in him and they were saved but there's salvation came with a cost you see their salvation their faith in Christ affected not just who they are but it affected really what happened around them in the things that happened to them and so they began to suffer as a result of their faith in and so they they were living in a time in which they're even future on Earth was uncertain and so they're there must have been a a pull in their heart on their life to to go back to the things the way things used to be why because the way things used to be it was just easier they didn't suffer like they suffered now his followers of the messiah's followers of Jesus Christ and so there was this continual Temptation and it on their lives to turn back to the old Covenant and so the writer of Hebrews one of the main themes that's established throughout this entire book is the Christ is better he's better than the sacrificial system he's better than the ceremonial isn't he's better than been trying to fulfill the commands of the Old Testament law Christ is better wife because he's the one who fulfilled every aspect of the law entirely and it while they could not fulfill it Jesus did so put your faith in the one who did for you what you could never do for yourself and therefore your future even though on Earth it is uncertain your future hope is tied to the promises of God in Christ that's the message of Hebrews that's why this book was written it was written to encourage these Believers to endure knowing not only that Christ was better than living under the requirements the old Covenant but also that they would have pained the future promises of God that were at that time on the scene to them so now it makes sense that the author would come and say okay Faith faith is vital faith is necessary living by faith is imperative for those who are in Christ now today people will mock the idea of living by faith because some have misused or wrongly Define the word for their own personal gain we're familiar with the word faith movement that treats God is a Genie in a Bottle that with every little whim or wish that you have you can go and you can rub the bottle and and if you have just enough faith in in the in the genie that comes out of the bottle then he'll give you exactly what you want what you wish what you desire and so if you want more money man he'll give that to you if you have faith if you need to be healed he'll give that to you if you have faith you want a bigger house he'll give that to you if you have faith it if you want a better position in life of a better job or promotion or something like that he'll give that to you if you just have enough faith if you if you want to be rich man I'm just plant the seed of $1,000 and that's my seed Will Spring forth into hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars that's the word faith movement a perverted the meaning of Faith they preferred it what God desires when he says You must live by faith and in such in so doing they if they've made really living by faith has a mockery to the outside world is watching others reject living by faith because living by faith looks risky living by faith looks crazy you're going to do what you believe what is your your Living For What you're not your life isn't really all about getting and having a new painting and securing for your future so that you can enjoy rest and read he's and and and relaxation for the rest of your life that you're that you're living for something Beyond this life what are you nuts why would you do something like that people think it's risky that is crazy and when I thought about that the reality is this plays into to the default orientation of our flash why because deep down we are people who crave assurance we want Assurance don't we when you go to buy a house or sell a house what do you require of the person who's buying the house from you you require earnest money why because you want the assurance that they're going to go ahead and finish this contract and buy the house at the amount that you agreed upon and so that earnest money then gives you a a little bit of a guarantee that they're going to finish what they started and they they sign a contract when's the last time you saw the house just by shaking somebody's hand and saying okay give me the money when you get a chance We crave insurance if you went to buy a car today you couldn't walk into a dealership and come to a settled price on the vehicle get the keys shake the hand with the manager of the dealership and say okay I'll send my first payment next month no they wouldn't let you take the car why because the the auto dealership wants the insurance that you're going to fulfill your commitment to them so you have to sign a contract would you put your money in a bank that didn't have FDIC insured why because you like Assurance it's the default orientation of our flesh we want assurance that things are going to be okay and so we are somewhat by Nature risk-averse when it comes to these things and the reality is we find Assurance in the things that we can see the things which are tangible the things that we can put our hands on therefore it is the grace of God that enables us to have faith that may look risky that may look crazy that faith and then to live by faith in God regardless of what we can see why is all this important because doing anything of any spiritual importance any spiritual significance demands living by faith both personally but also corporately together as a church the reality is the One Vision campaign in and providing for the future of the ministry of CrossPointe Church isn't anything that was that one person can do by themselves but it requires that every member of CrossPointe every person who caused Crosspoint home acting and moving forward in faith trusting that God will provide for our needs believing that he will do so now and into the future I was thinking about this while I was away I thought you were far too long it seems that the we have just simply been reacting to what God is doing but I think we we need to move to the point where we were anticipating and that we're demonstrating faith in the God who established this church who is right now growing this church who desires to use this church took continually lead people to connect and commit to Jesus Christ until Jesus himself returns and so it requires faith we move forward by faith therefore it's imperative that every believer must live by faith because biblical Faith enables God's people to live boldly how exactly does biblical Faith allow us to live boldly won't answer that question by showing you three fundamentals of biblical Faith from the text that we read today the first one is this faith in God is founded upon the promises of God if you look at the the text in front of you it says now Faith is the Assurance of things hoped for the conviction of Things Not Seen now Faith board now is a continuance of conjunction it's meant to buy the author connect what he is already said to what he is saying and so that it's one idea or one thought now those who translated scripture from the original tax they added the verse of the chapter and verse divisions and they did so to make it easier for reference purposes but the reality is that you can only understand what he says in chapter 11 by understanding what he has said in the versus previous to this he's saying that everything I'm about to say is based on that which I have already revealed that which I have already said and end so he he stated this in verse number 39 that we those of us who are saved those of us who redeem those of us who have placed their faith and trust in Jesus Christ as The One and Only Hope of Salvation we are not of those who shrink back we don't walk away from we don't we don't disengage we don't retreat we don't turn back to the old Covenant we don't go back to the way things used to be we are not of those kind of people but of those who have faith and because we have faith we persevere we continue we move forward we advance we continue to follow the lord no matter where God wants us to go no matter what situation or circumstance we find ourselves in we don't back away we continue to move forward it's only uses this conjunction now because he wants them to talk about what faith does he throws this word out here faith we are not of those who shrink back there destroyed by those who have faith in persevere so their souls or preserve their souls and then he says now Faith is present active indicative faith is let me just explain to you as clearly as I can't what that means what the author says about faith about what faith does it was true the moment he wrote that but it is also it was also true before it was ever written down and it remains true today that face is something that face is this thing that does something it was true then it's true now so what does that mean it means believe we could anchor ourselves to this text wife because while it was written for a group of people 2000 years ago it is every bit as relevant to us today it is just as true for us today as it was back then so what does faith do faith is the assurance the Greek word homeostasis it's used three times New Testament all three times in the book of Hebrews and it is used in similar but different ways if that makes sense SOS I was looking through trying to figure out kit what is the what is the usage of this word how is this word used that the best thing that I can come up with is that it is meant to serve as some sort of a foundation that upholds that supports that can take really the weight of that which is built on top of it you do whenever somebody build a building they they pour the concrete before they pull in for the concrete what are they do they they put the rebar down those steel rods in a crisscross pattern all the way through and then they pour the steel are the concrete on top of that what is the rebar do the rebar reinforces the concrete to make it stronger and stable so that it can receive the weight of the building and hold up over time that's what faith is face does that for us now now face is ultimately first and foremost in got it is in what God has done it is what God has promised to us faith is the Assurance it is the the foundation of things hoped for snow we'd look at hoping and if you've been here long enough you understand that the word hope isn't the way that we sometimes think of the word hope we hope it's a nice day tomorrow or are we hope lunch is good today or or we hope it's easy to get out of here today and we don't have to sit in traffic for forever we hope this or that no hope is is this confident expectation did the we're confident that that something is going to take place that that we expect something to be done something to be given something to be provided faith is the assurance some translations say it's the substance of things hoped for but when you look at that you have to ask yourself the question why do we hope in what are we hoping in whom are we hoping in whom or in what is our confident expectation placed or the words that you will find throughout Hebrews 10 and 11 actually the end of chapter 10 and into chapter 11 is the the idea of promised promised to look at with me if you would inverse number 36 chapter 10 verse number 36 for you have need of endurance so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is what promised if you drop down into chapter number 11 and you go to verse number 11 it says what that talk about Sarah by Sarah her put herself received power to conceive even when she was past the age since she considered him faithful who had promised now the story Sarah was well beyond child-bearing years but yet. Pulled Abraham from your union with Sarah from that marital Union one will, some will come from that Union I'm through that son will come the blessings that I promised you that that by your line in through your line all of the earth will be blessed and Sarah here according to chapter 11 even though she laughed initially when she heard I didn't don't be too hard on Sarah if you were 97 years old and someone said hey guess what you're going to have a baby ladies you would laugh to write husband's you were just flat pass out but it says that she considered him why did she believe that she was going to have a child because the promise has been made to her and she considered him who made the promise to be faithful look at verse number 13 these all died in faith not having received the things promised drop down all the way to verse number 39 all these though commended through their faith and not receive what was promised now it's important for us to understand and know what the promise was the promise they were looking toward was the Messiah the promise they were looking toward was the the one that all of the the ceremonial laws and sacrifices to it was the the promise that that from the woman I would come a son of deliver who would eventually destroy the enemy and provide a way of salvation for God's people it was the promise of Jesus Christ it was the promise of a messiah who would come live a perfect life die a sacrificial death on the cross for our sins as our substitute as our savior and be buried and rise again there there hope their focus was on this promise that there would be an ultimate deliver and they all died not having received the promise that's the difference between us and them as they were looking forward to the cross and we're looking back at the cross to see the Promise has been delivered but the reality is that they had a confident expectation faith is the substance faith is the Assurance faith is the the foundation of things hoped for the things hoped for are the promises of God these people based their lives on the promises that God made and in the same way brothers and sisters our life need to be based upon the promises that God has made yes or our lives are are firmly fixed on the promise of Salvation in Christ but yes also we need to understand that every promise that God has made is true and a God himself will deliver upon every single promise faith objectively binds the Believers securely it's the Assurance of things hoped for to that which is real the conviction to CertainTeed the proof of Things Not Seen we live each and every day in light of the fact that we believe that we anchor our lives two things that that you and I have not yet seen and this is the substance that holds us up this is the this is the the substance this is the foundation of life for us this is because we have the promises of God while I was on vacation I was thinking about this I was thinking about the series I was thinking about this message a little bit and I put a lot of thought time thought into this and I thought about it maybe you've never really wondered this why are Disciples of Jesus Christ believers I really thought about that I spent some time on vacation think about this and I've got a really profound answer for you I mean it's deep it took me a long time ready for it get you can get the paper write this down we're called believers because we believe right see how you can you're not nearly as amazed as I was we're Believers because we believe what do we believe we believe in the promises of God we believe that God promised to send his son and his son came lived died that he made payment for our sin that that our guilt and and rightful judgment was transferred to him on the cross and that that he with his blood paid that debt for us and that it is Resurrection the father is fully satisfied with the payment made by the sun we we believe that he ascended up into heaven we believe that he sits right now at the right hand of the Throne of God we believe that one day he is coming again and when he comes again he will receive us unto himself that where he is there we will be also we believe that we will forever be with the Lord we believe this we believe it with everything in a so much so that it determines how we live our lives or at least it should someone wrote Faith furnishes the heart with Firm support in the revealed Promises of God faith believe God I believe God is revealed in scripture and that Faith scripture says isn't anchor we see it here as an anchor laid out in the experience of Believers real Faith gives us a confidence substance in the present another word for biblical faith is not something that that we wish might happen in the future it is not a hope in some chance biblical faith is basing our entire life on the things that God has promised knowing being absolutely confident that even though we can't see them they will come to pass therefore the enemies of Faith biblical Faith are not doubt and fear those are merely symptoms that reveal that you don't trust the promises of God when you have a promise of God laid out for you in the word and and in light of that promise you're afraid what is that fear doing that fear is revealing a lack of trust in the promise of God if in the midst of having a promise from God and His word whether it's for your spiritual or your temporal need or even your Eternal future and mist of having a promise from God that you sit there and you begin to doubt whether or not that's true what are you saying you're saying God I don't trust you to deliver upon your promise and brothers and sisters that's a dangerous place to be listen sometimes we can be pretty skeptical about who to trust in this life why because we know that human beings are not fully trustworthy but please don't transfer to God what is true of humans while humans will let you down while people will not always deliver upon their promise while while people are not always true and trustworthy God is always true and trustworthy and God will always deliver on every single promise that he's made to you if he said he will provide for your every need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus he is going to do it if he said that he's going to take you to be with him if you place your faith and trust in his son he's going to do it you can live with that insurance every single day that means the promises of God must have governed you individually it means that the promises of God must govern us corporately as a church the God said he would build his church we believe he's building it here through us but there are other churches Bible preaching churches by God's grace being planted and he'll build his church through them we're not alone but we have a responsibility here ultimately we're talking about what Biblical Faith does it it it doesn't just ground us and give us a certainty of Things Not Seen but biblical Faith also moves us to action is so when we believe the promises of God then faith in God provides confidence to follow the will of God the author of Hebrews further explained really the character and ineffective Faith by pointing to the the example of God's people in the Old Testament to show that that this kind of Faith moved them to follow God why because they believe God notice what it says a number 24 by it what's it faith by faith this is talking about AAA not necessarily a tool not looking at at the faith is a screwdriver in the hand of God in which he he accomplishes this something something know this is the idea of a process by faith it it it leads to a process when we are convinced that that God is true and trustworthy and we rest and rely on his promises then it it does something in our heart and our mind and it it moves as it drives us to action and he used the illustration of all of these Old Testament Saints who had faith in the promises of God and then acted on that face even though sometimes it didn't make any sense let me point out a few of them to you drop down to 1st and parade by faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance and look at the next Rays and he went out not knowing where he was going that's stupid right are you look at that and say okay that makes literally no sense it is you want to think how well that works fellows here's what you do you go home today you tell your wife okay honey we're selling the house we're selling everything in the house we're going to get the car I'm going to start driving your wife may save to where are we driving and what you would say don't know why are we going to do this because it's what I'm supposed to do yeah but but where we going to live don't know how long will you be driving don't know where do stop don't know okay let's go right now who does that but yet Abraham had a faith in the promise of God how do we know that look at her Summer Night by Faith he went to live in the land of promise as in a foreign land living in tents with Isaac and Jacob heirs with him of the same promised noticed for he was looking forward to the city that has foundations whose designer and Builder is God he was bolstered by a faith in the promise of God of something he could not even see but it drove him to obey God even when by all human means it made zero sense it looked risky and foolish looking for summer 17 by faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac this is the son of the promise and he who had received the promises was in the are active offering up his only son God told Abraham take your son to son of the promise and sacrifice them to me Abraham took him bound him put it on put them up on an altar took the knife was ready to plunge it into his son when God stopped him what would drive a man to go that far he was absolutely confident of the promise of God and he knew that God would deliver on the promise one way or another how do we know that it says he considered that God was able to even this is her summer 19th to raise him from the dead from which figuratively speaking he did receive him back. And Abraham was like you know what if God tells me to do this I have so much faith in who God is and what God has said in the promise of God that even though I can't see how this will work or why this will work I know that God is going to work by faith verse number 23 Moses when he was born was hidden for three months by his parents which was directed to obedience to the government to the king to the pharaoh of Egypt who ordered that all Hebrew babies at the time would be killed my paper store 27 who left Egypt not being afraid of the anger of the king why because God told him to leave God said take my people to the to a place that I prepared for them the land of their fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob who cares if Pharaoh says don't go who cares if you don't know how you're going to get there or what is going to cost you to get there or what you're going to do when you get there you follow me even if the king Won't Let You Go by faith first over 29 people cross the Red Sea as on dry land cuz God told them to cross by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they have been in circle for 7 days why because God told them to encircle the walls for 7 days first number 33 These Old Testament Saints who through faith conquered kingdoms enforce Justice obtain promises stopped the mouths of lions Quince the fight the power of fire escape the edge of the sword were made strong out of weakness became Mighty and War put foreign armies to fly they all did this why because they believe God they believe the promise of God and because they believe the promise of God they acted in obedience to God and therefore scripture says they received their commendation by faith the people of old received their combination of this does not mean that they were saved because of the things that they did they were not saved because they obeyed these commands of God as they were walking through a life together no it means that their faith proved but their actions prove their faith and that God recognized them that their faith was genuine we'll see if I can illustrate it this way on August 18th 2018 6 u.s. soldiers were password protected with protecting us a senior us delegation delegation of senior us officials in Kandahar City Afghanistan when they were attacked by Taliban fighters who had infiltrated the Afghan Security Forces immediately they sprung to action and they they put down the threatened and they secured the area they offered Medical Aid medical assistance to to the people who needed it at the moment they were shortly thereafter awarded the Army Commendation Medal simply meeting this that the metal screws that their leaders approved of their actions now follow me for those who think that we are saved by our works we're not we're only saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone so he's not here saying that that we received the approval of God in a Salvation way because of our actions the soldiers that I I mentioned they they did not gain entrance to the Army based on what they did they were already in the Army which is why they did what they did the same way the people of the Old Testament live by faith and it was Faith demonstrated that God commended reproved the Bible says in Romans chapter 4 verse or three Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness inverse number 6 it says without faith it is impossible to please him for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists in the rewards those who seek him what's a no one is saved by works there's nothing that you can do to earn God's approval faith is a gift that God brings and faith is a gift that that God brings the grace of Salvation bring the brings the grace of God in Salvation those who Trust In Christ Alone for salvation of a living faith this is the point of a living faith that is expressed in obedience to the will of God this means that you will live to follow him why because you trust him let that you're you gain everlasting life through faith in him and and that you live daily because of faith in him versarac 3080 quotes of a kit 24 in chapter 10 but my righteous one shall live by faith the reality is you can trust God why because he's already done the greatest most undeserved things for you he saved your soul he's redeemed you he's forgiven you of sin so you can you can trust him and you can trust him to to do what he said he would do that's why I asked you this question or your actions a witness to your faith are your action to witness to your faith that leads to the third thing faith in God acknowledges the power of God first number three is really illustrative he tries to make the issue of Faith even more clear the author provides a and illustration by directing his readers to Creation specifically that Faith brings us to grasp that Faith brings us to understand that God created all things by his work so this is what the author of Hebrews is doing is taking these Jewish Believers and he's he's dragging them back to Genesis 1 and he's saying listen in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth in the Genesis 1 and 2 we see come by the word of God the sun and moon and stars that came into being by the word of God of the sea was created by the word of God Dryland appeared by the word of God. The Seas were filled with all sorts of of of marine animals by the word of God the land was filled with all sorts of land animals and insects by the word of God the heavens were filled with all sorts of birds by that by the power of God human beings were created by by God's power he brought everything into existence and he made it all out of nothing X neilio he he didn't use something that was already there to pick to bring about something else know he did something that only God can do you and I can make something out of something we can take an element that already exists a material that already exists and we can transform that we can make something different out of that to meet a specific purpose or or to meet a specific need but not one of us in this room and nobody who has ever lived on this Earth save the Son of God himself has the power to take nothing and make something out of it so follow me hear what you saying is listen to this this one in whom you have faith this this faith that anchors your soul because it's based in the promises of God this God who made the promises is all-powerful he he not only has the character to make promises and to fulfill these promises he has the power to bring these things to pass he has the power to make new a life that is steeped in sin and broken when you call out in faith and trust in Jesus Christ Alone he he has the power to make you a new creation he has the power to bring you to himself he has the power to deliver on every single promise that he makes oftentimes in our minds we think of God in a way that is not helpful we think of God in terms of what we can see and what we can do ourselves I I I I can't imagine a human being not being or being able to do that and so we think of God in in those types of perms yeah God is Limitless and power God is not weak and untrustworthy God is the almighty and he has the power to do everything he's promised so here's a question you need to consider how does God's power change your life everyday the power of God ought to have a real effect on how we lived a lie if it does nothing else but it ought to cause us to live boldly listen we live in a world in which people continually boldly brashly display their sinfulness we live in a world where where people will take their their cell phones and record themselves speaking all sorts of vile evil perverse Wicked terrible things things that were Unthinkable a generation ago and they will still record themselves saying it with a smile on their face and then they'll post it on social media so than everybody else can see their wickedness we live in a Time in which men dressing up in a caricature of women in lingerie go into to public places and dance sexually in front of small children and these people are applauded for their bravery and their courageousness by the society and we whose lives are built on this Foundation a face and the promises of God we who have been affected by and are being transformed by the power of God say nothing we're silent listen to people of God cannot live timidly today our God can be trusted to deliver upon every one of his promises and so we have the confidence to follow him no matter the circumstance no matter the situation because he has the power to do what he said he would do it so this applies to every one of us was in Christ does your life reflect bold faith in the God of all creation this applies to all of us here at Crosspoint will we in fact demonstrate our faith by moving forward together to do whatever we need to do to reach this and successive generations with the truth of the Glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ do you think it's worth it I said before the faith is not clearly defined in Scripture what scripture clearly reveals what faith does and then makes it clear that every believer must live by faith why because Faith ultimately honors God and pushes us his people to move forward are you living by faith does your supposed faith in Christ as your supposed faith in God directly affect how you lit everyday it ought to for his glory and purpose will you play with me or thank you forgiving us faith we know that the kind of Faith exists as a gift of your common Grace to every person Lord that's how we operate day in and day out we're talking about faith specifically in you it's the saving Faith it's a two Living

this one question do you know that you are saved to be saved means that you are safe from God's judgment and condemnation you see God is a perfect and holy God and as creator of all things God created humans to love and worship him and be loved by him but all Humanity has rebelled against God and has been separated from God and is condemned by God why because God cannot and will not except sin and sinful people and God could have wiped his hands of humanity and left us to perish but God loved us so much that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life you see God did not just say he loves you God prove his love for you when he gave his son to die on the cross for you while you were still a sinner because Jesus Paid the price for your sin you could be safe from God's judgment and you can receive God's mercy instead of God's condemnation there's no work that you have to do there's no price that you could ever pay to receive
