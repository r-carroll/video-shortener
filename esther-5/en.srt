00:00:00,100 --> 00:01:06,000
Find if you would Esther chapter 5, the fifth chapter of the Book of Esther. You know, some might look at the story of Esther and see only a series of coincidences. Well, you know, it's just a coincidence that the king in a drunken stupor would call out to the queen vashti and insist that she present herself in front of himself and other drunk men in a way that we had degrade the office of Queen. And therefore she said that she would not come and she was eventually deposed because of that action, which then opened the door for a new Queen. We might look and say, well, you know, it's just a coincidence that Mordecai and Esther remained and Susa it's just a coincidence that Esther would have found favor in the eyes of those to whom she was responsible and that she would eventually find and favor in the eyes of the king and be elevated to the role of Queen.

2
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:45,600
What she was then able to go and tell Esther and Esther told the king and the plot was discovered and stopped sparing the life of a shoe. Eros, some would say well it was just a coincidence. That Haman was promoted for reasons that are never revealed to us in The Narrative of Esther.

3
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:58,100
But eventually he was put into a position whereby he could convince the king to issue an order calling for the extermination of all the Jews in the Persian Empire.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Just a lot of coincidences, it was just a coincidence that Esther then was in position to be able to potentially do something to help.

5
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,800
A lot of coincidences.

6
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,900
But what if I told you that there are, there really is no such thing as coincidence.

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:50,500
What if I told you that, you know, coincidence is something that we think of. It's, It's a term that we think in. But coincidence doesn't truly exist. Like, we think it does yet. It's part of our lexicon. It's part of the Lexicon of Our Lives. We constantly talk about coincidences, if you were to go to the store today and and meet somebody that you hadn't seen, since you were in high school or in college, you would think, wow, what a coincidence that we are together in the same.

8
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Or at the same time. Walking down the same aisle. And we came together today.

9
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:18,900
We think of and we speak in terms of coincidence but there's no such thing as coincidence. What if I told you that there are times when God brings difficulties that are not coincidental but God brings difficulties and those difficulties serve a greater purpose than you might understand.

10
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,800
Look with me and Esther chapter number 5, beginning in verse number one,

11
00:03:27,700 --> 00:04:27,300
On the third day, Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner Court of the king's Palace in front of the Kings Quarters. While the King was sitting on his Royal Throne inside the throne room opposite, the entrance to the Palace. Now you're going to see here in verse number one the repetition of the word Royal she put on her royal robes. He was sitting on his Royal Throne inside the palace. The the intent of the author is to paint a picture for Is that these people were not hanging out in some ordinary Place, doing something ordinary, but this is something extraordinary. This is something outside the realm of what we would consider normal for ourselves that this is situated that this is set in an extraordinary place during an extraordinary time. And we see people who are extraordinary in human perspective but just ordinary creations of God as we look at it from a divine.

12
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:51,600
Esther is asked, so the king and Haman Came To The Feast that Esther had prepared and as they were drinking wine after the feast the king said to Esther, what is your wish? It shall be granted you and what is your request even to half the of my kingdom? It shall be fulfilled. Then Esther answered my wish and my request is If I have found favor in the sight of the king and if it please the king to Grant my wish and fulfill my request. Let the king do is the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them. And tomorrow, I will do as the king is said and Haman, went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the Kings gate, that he neither Rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against more than Mordecai.

13
00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:22,500
Nevertheless Haman, restrained himself and went home and sent, and brought his friends and his wives Arash and Heyman recounted to them, the Splendor of his riches. The number of his sons all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had Advanced him above the officials and the Servants of the king. Then Heyman said, even Queen Esther, let no one. But me come with the King To The Feast, she prepared. And tomorrow, also, I am invited by her together with the King,

14
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:22,800
Ng.

15
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,100
Yet, all of this is worth nothing to me.

16
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,400
As long as I see, Mordecai the Jew sitting in the Kingsgate.

17
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Then his wife is a rash and all his friends said to him, let a Gallows fifty cubits High be made and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the King To The Feast this idea. Please Damon and he had the Gallows made Lord God, you're good to us, in gathering us together, in a place where we can freely.

18
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,500
That we require a Divine Aid.

19
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
To understand it.

20
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
And to apply it.

21
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
And so God, I pray that you would give that Aid now.

22
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,900
that we would see this not just as a story that took place a long time ago.

23
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,000
But Lord, that we might understand the purpose.

24
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,100
For which you have given this to us.

25
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,500
And that it might impact Our Lives.

26
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Lord, I pray that you would enable us to see clearly that which needs to be seen.

27
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,600
And understood.

28
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
And applied For Your Glory.

29
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,100
For the greater purpose that you have for our lives, is your people.

30
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:11,900
so, father, open our eyes help us to see and understand We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Your God, often allows difficulties to expose the orientation of your heart.

31
00:08:29,500 --> 00:09:13,200
For nothing that they had done. Truly, this whole thing comes back to the reality that Mordecai made Haman, mad and Haman, instead of just simply trying to deal with the problem by Dealing with one man has said, no, no, that's not enough. Someone like me needs to make a bigger Splash and so I'm going to make sure that all of the Jews in the entire Kingdom, pay for what this one man has done. It's a time of great difficulty and I know that we typically speak in the language of coincidence, but c.s., Lewis, attribute is attributed to have said, coincidence is God's way of remaining Anonymous, you know, God's name is not mentioned.

32
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
Isaac to Jacob.

33
00:09:46,500 --> 00:10:30,300
And our Sovereign, God the same God who is working behind the scenes in the story of Esther that same. God is just a sovereign today, as he was when this event was taking place that same, God is just as Sovereign today. As he has ever been. He is Sovereign he remained Sovereign and he will often don't miss this. He will often allow difficulties to assail you because he wants to expose you to the orientation of your Your heart. He wants to pull back the curtain so that you can see how your heart is oriented. And one of the ways he does, that is by bringing us into difficult situations.

34
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,800
Now, from a human perspective, we don't like the sovereignty of God.

35
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,700
And let me tell you why we don't like the sovereignty of God, because if God is Sovereign, that means we're not.

36
00:10:50,900 --> 00:11:00,000
Right and and we don't like the idea of someone other than ourselves being in control.

37
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,900
I don't like to ride with anybody in a car.

38
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm serious. I don't when my kids were learning how to drive scared the fire out of me. Why? Because I'm not the one behind the wheel. Therefore, I didn't teach them how to drive. I let Rebecca do it and I would ride with him right before they took the test.

39
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,600
And when I'm reminded from the truth of God's word that I am not in control in any way.

40
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,500
It doesn't always sit well with me.

41
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Just a minute ago. You all sang to the top of your lungs. We will trust in you.

42
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:01,300
Perfect. Savior, strong Defender, we will trust in you. You know what? It's really, really, really easy to sing. Those words, isn't it?

43
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:12,400
It's an entirely different thing. When we are put into a situation whereby we must actually trust him.

44
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:22,600
When we realize that we truly have no control whatsoever. And the only thing that we can do,

45
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,200
Is to step back and say, okay God, I have to trust you.

46
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
With my child.

47
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,700
I have to trust you with my spouse. I have to trust you with my finances. I have to trust you with fill in the blank.

48
00:12:38,800 --> 00:13:29,900
Oh standing among a group of Believers listening to beautiful music being played by the band and singing out we will trust in you. That is so easy. But when you actually have to do it you have to acknowledge the truth that God is The Sovereign one and that you are not and because we don't like the sovereignty of God, we begin to look at things and and the things that people do specifically and the things that happen in the world around us and and we begin to declare that that God can't be Sovereign in the way that scripture defines sovereignty and declares sovereignty. Why? Because if God is Sovereign, then why are all these terrible things happening around us? Why do we see so many sinful things playing out on the stage in front of us? If God is truly Sovereign in a control of everything then surely he could stop these bad things from happening.

49
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,300
The men and women in this story.

50
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,900
They were not being controlled.

51
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,700
As passive.

52
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Figures.

53
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:11,300
When I was a kid, I loved g.i., Joe and Transformers. I would get home from school and I would watch really three cartoons Scooby-Doo.

54
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,100
Amen. Right. I may not get another amen. The rest of the time from some of you but I said Scooby-Doo and you're like preach it brother.

55
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Transformers, and GI Joe.

56
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:54,300
And I would get g.i., Joe toys and Transformer, Transformer toys, and for Christmas, and for my birthday. And, and I would play with those toys. The crazy thing about it is that when I laid those toys down on the ground, they didn't pick themselves up and position themselves in battle, ready positions, right? Toy Story is fake. It's just a cartoon they don't really do that.

57
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:33,500
To position and we do things just according to the way he wants them to be done. And that is a simplistic view of the sovereignty of God.

58
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:55,000
We see here that God, is, is behind everything that has taken place, and that God is orchestrating, everything that is taking place, every move. That is made every step that is taken. That sounds like that song, right? Every move you make every step you take I don't know why I went there but it just didn't my head.

59
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,900
The actions of the people involved in the narrative.

60
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:36,800
These people were not compelled to act, contrary to their Wills, but God worked through their actions to accomplish his purposes. Peter describe this for us. When he preached on Pentecost talking about Christ, he said this Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God you crucified and killed by the hands of Lawless men.

61
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:57,700
It was God's purpose for Christ to come and to live and to die on the cross. This was set in motion before the very foundation of the world but yet God, used the sinful actions of human beings as the tools where by what God had willed to happen actually took place.

62
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,800
Makes sense.

63
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:27,800
That's what we see Happening Here. God is behind the scenes, God purposes. What is going to take place? And yet he uses the actions, the good and even the sinful actions of the people involved to accomplish that purpose. One author, said God achieves, his perfect goals, not just through our best intentions and most self-sacrificing acts, but even through our greatest sins and compromises,

64
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,400
maybe that's not something that brings Comfort to you, but as a center that brings great comfort to me,

65
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,800
I'm glad to know that my sinful acts don't derail the plan and purpose of God.

66
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:54,300
But God is so great and so powerful. And so, Sovereign that he can take, even the sinful things that I do and turn them, and use those to accomplish his purpose and Glory.

67
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:24,100
And sometimes because of our actions and sometimes because of nothing that we've done God, who is Sovereign in control of all things brings difficulties, but God sees to it. And here's what, I don't want you to miss, God sees to it that, for his people, the purpose of those difficulties is never ever wasted. In other words, we don't just go through hard times to go through hard times.

68
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:46,800
God is not some sadistic vindictive being who is up there thinking, you know what, how can I make them suffer? How can I make life difficult? Just because I can No, for the believer. Every single thing helps to accomplish the purpose of God in us.

69
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:58,600
And so what do the difficulties of Life accomplish? How how to difficulties expose the the orientation of the Hartwell?

70
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,700
This story does not provide for us and exhaustive list of the ways.

71
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:20,500
That God uses difficulties to accomplish things in our life. But there are two conclusions that we can draw from the difficulties presented in this chapter. The first is this that Esther when difficulty came became selfless,

72
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:52,000
Now, the author shows us in chapter 5. The Esther we've come to know from chapter 2, so if you remember the flow of the story, Esther was not seen in chapter 1. She comes into onto the scene in Chapter 2, where by she's elevated to the role and office of Queen. She's not seeing again in chapter number three, she enters the scene a second time in chapter 4,

73
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:16,000
Or and then the first part of the narrative in chapter 5 is really focused on this woman Esther. And some of the things that we see in chapter 5 are the same things that we saw about her in Chapter 2. So we see essentially the same person. However, we see the same person who is now using, who she is not for her own selfish ends.

74
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,500
But for a selfless purpose.

75
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:50,500
So, just to bring you up to speed on what's going on here at the end of chapter, number 4 Esther had learned, the plan of Haman. He she had learned the edict that had been sent out throughout the kingdom that all of the Jews were going to be annihilated that all of the Jews were going to be killed and the destruction was complete. That it was exhaustive that if this plan was carried out, not one single Jew would be alive in.

76
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,900
In the entire Persian Kingdom.

77
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:13,800
She had no idea that that was even a thing. She was just living in the walls of the palace going on, about her luxurious life. And then she heard from Mordecai that this thing had happened and her initial reaction. If you remember was in essence, wow, that sounds really, really bad. Sorry,

78
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:28,600
if I go to the king and and try to talk to the king about this unannounced, I could lose my own life, that's not really part of my plan and so Good luck.

79
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,800
And then Mordecai sends another message to her, and the other message is this? Okay, Esther.

80
00:21:42,900 --> 00:22:12,300
You know what you think you're safe in The Palace. They know you're a Jew now and and so you're not actually safe there anymore than what we are outside of the palace. But but we know that Deliverance for the Jews is going to come from some other place. You and your father's house are going to die but maybe, just maybe who knows is the language given to us in chapter 4. Who knows? If you have attained this position in the Kingdom?

81
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,300
For such a time as this for this purpose.

82
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,700
To do something.

83
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
About the situation.

84
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:38,900
And to that Esther responded. Okay, we're going to fast for 3 Days. Myself and my maids and told all of the Jewish people to fast for three days and then I will go in and break the law and see the king.

85
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,700
And if I perish, I perish.

86
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,600
I might lose my life for this, and if I do at least, I died for something doing something, instead of doing nothing.

87
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,100
So we come to chapter 5.

88
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,400
And we see.

89
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Some really laudable characteristics of Esther that she employed in chapter 22.

90
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,200
Ascend to the throne.

91
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,600
And now she's using them for a greater higher purpose. Notice what it says about her on the third day,

92
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,600
what does it tell us? It tells us that Esther was prepared.

93
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:53,600
It tells us that she took the responsibility of of going before the king to present a petition to save the people. Very seriously so much so that she fasted for three days. Now, some people like to say that prayer is implied in the fasting but the narrative the text doesn't actually say that prayer is what took place that prayer happened and so we're just going to act like because it's not in the text it's not really something that should guide our thinking maybe she prayed.

94
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,900
Don't know, we do know that she fasted and that fasting was most likely a time to prepare yourself physically mentally and maybe even spiritually.

95
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,300
To take a huge risk.

96
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,600
To go before the king without being invited.

97
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:23,800
And so she prepared herself much, like she prepared herself to go into the king the first time in chapter number two, she was prepared. Notice what else she put on Royal robes?

98
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,400
She was thoughtful.

99
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:56,700
She understood that you know what? I'm not going to Walmart in my pajamas and Crocs. Why do people go to Walmart and pajamas and cry? I don't understand that. If anybody can explain that to me, I would maybe like to hear that maybe not. I don't know. But she knew that she had a serious responsibility. A serious job. So what did she do? She put on the Robes of royalty.

100
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,300
She put on her queenly, garments.

101
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,900
The finest.

102
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,900
In the Kingdom.

103
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
She put the crown on her head.

104
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
She prepared herself to gain an audience with the King.

105
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
Something to be said about preparation.

106
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,800
She prepared. And she was thoughtful much like she was in Chapter 2 when she said, what is it? That the king likes?

107
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,700
What is it that I can do?

108
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
Then we see.

109
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,200
That she stood in the inner Court.

110
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,100
And that she waited.

111
00:25:45,300 --> 00:26:08,800
To be acknowledged. Now, she clearly didn't go into the throne room because had she gone into the throne room. The King, this is verified by historical documents. The king would have had behind him. A couple of guys. One maybe two, wielding axes. And so if she had just rushed right into the throne room, one of those guys would have just pulled and taken off her head.

112
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:45,100
Instead of thinking that she because she's the queen, had a right to do, what nobody else could do. No, she got to where she was within his line of sight and maybe I don't know. This is speculation. Perhaps the light hit a jewel, in her crown, in such a way, or a jewel that she was wearing in such a way that the light refracted off of that, and, and caught the Kings eye. And he turned his attention to see her. And, and when he saw her, what did he do? He held out the scepter,

113
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Which then allowed her to come into His presence, and she came in, and she did so not rushing into his presence, not with bravado, not with any kind of arrogance. But she came in humbly.

114
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,100
And she touched the scepter.

115
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,700
and she said,

116
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,300
if it please the king.

117
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,400
She understood her role. She understood her position.

118
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,400
And she exercised, great humility.

119
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,900
And then she went to work.

120
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:37,500
And what we see in the rest of this half of the narrative is really Esther, executing a plan that she had thought through very well.

121
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:49,300
She was skillful in what she did and how she did it. She said, if it please the king, let the king and Haman.

122
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,600
Why not just the king?

123
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Why Haman, too?

124
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:04,300
Because she knows what she's doing. One of the things that we can tell about Esther from The Narrative is that she evidently had a propensity inability to read people.

125
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:56,500
And she knew how to put people into places. So that the maximum effect and benefit would take place meeting with the King Alone. Wasn't the goal. No, she wanted Haman to be there as well. And so, she says come to the feast today that I have prepared for you. The king So the kingdom calls out, Bring Heyman, he's got to come, so we can go together quickly to meet with the queen and have dinner and so they had dinner and then they were drinking. And then the king says to Esther a second time, what is it that you want? So, this tells us that the king knew and understood that Esther wanted something, it wasn't that she just wanted to prepare a meal for him. She wanted something, he knew that. Now, he's a pretty ignorant, foolish, guy.

126
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,300
So, she must have been dropping some pretty hefty. Hence,

127
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
what is your wish?

128
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,600
It shall be. Granted you, what is your request even to half my kingdom? It shall be fulfilled.

129
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Now half my kingdom was hyperbole, he wasn't planning on giving up half the kingdom. What he was telling Esther is this? I have the power to give you what you're asking. What you asked for? Trust me.

130
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
All you have to do is ask.

131
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,800
What is it that you want?

132
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,300
So,

133
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
she continues.

134
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
My wish and my request is now.

135
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,700
In the Hebrew, it seems as own almost if there should be an ellipsis here dot dot dot.

136
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:12,400
But there's a pause. My wish is Some people speculate that she lost her nerve here that she was fully planning on saying. Listen Haman has convinced you to kill all of my people. I need you to rescind that order.

137
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,900
I think what's happening is She skillfully fishing.

138
00:30:46,900 --> 00:31:02,600
And then she starts reeling it in more, and the king is coming closer and closer and, and he's just about ready to take a nibble. And she Yanks it again and she's trying to set it just in the right position. So at the right time, the king B,

139
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,000
and then she can make a request known. She says as much here, she says, listen come to a feast tomorrow.

140
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:38,000
That I'm going to prepare for them. Now, notice something in verse number four, she said I prepared A Feast for the king Put down in verse number 8. She says that she's prepared The Feast for. She will prepare the Feast for them. The king and Haman Haman is like, wow, you're preparing A Feast for me.

141
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Tomorrow.

142
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,700
I will do as the king of said.

143
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll tell you tomorrow.

144
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,400
One of the things you have to understand here is this is a, this is a complex issue.

145
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:06,600
And it's a risky issue. What she's asking the king. What she will ask the king to do is no small thing. That's why I believe she did just barge right in and just blast right out, right?

146
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,400
She was skillfully working the problem.

147
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,400
To achieve the desired end.

148
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,000
The story is told of Alexander the Great who marched his army into turkey and he was shown the knot of gorgeous.

149
00:32:26,000 --> 00:33:03,700
And the not of gorgeous was a not, that was so huge and so complex that it was humanly impossible anti but the legend was any man who could successfully untie the knot would rule over all of Asia. So when Alexander the Great and his troops marched into turkey, he was introduced to and presented the not of gorgeous and he was told to story. And so he began to mess with the not. The story goes for a few minutes became frustrated, as everybody was watching him fail at untying, this not And he essentially thought, you know what, it doesn't say how it needs to be untied, he took his sword and hacked, the not two pieces, so that it fell apart right in front of everybody.

150
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:41,300
Daniel was familiar with this. Why? Because when Darius, the Persian king enacted, a law said, no one can pray to anybody, but you for the next 30 days and Daniel did it the king regrettably through Daniel in the Lion's Den? Why? Because he had to follow his own law,

151
00:33:42,800 --> 00:34:09,300
And for a Persian king to fail to follow his own law would be a self admitting failure that he himself did not have the strength, the power of the force to execute his own word. And so Esther coming along saying listen, you need to write off this law so that the Jews aren't killed. It would have made the king. Look, unbelievably bad.

152
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,300
Feckless powerless in front of his people.

153
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:25,500
So Esther needed to, to manufacture to do things in such a way that it would be very, very hard for the king to wiggle out of a promise that he's made.

154
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
So, follow along.

155
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,200
Esther, what is your wish?

156
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
You will have it.

157
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,600
Esther, what is your wish?

158
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:53,600
You will have it up to half of my kingdom tomorrow. I'll tell you king Esther. What is your wish three times? The king will have promised to give Esther what she's looking for. Esther is a smart girl.

159
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:05,000
She knows what she's doing. She's putting the king into a position where it would be almost impossible for him to deny her request.

160
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,000
And so we see Esther.

161
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,900
Many of the same traits on display in chapter 5.

162
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:31,800
With which she won favor in the eyes of all, who saw her in Chapter 2 and eventually won the grace and favor of the king. These things are once again on display. She's prepared. She's thoughtful, she's humble, she skillfully, executing her plan only this time.

163
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,800
She worked to help others. Instead of herself.

164
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,300
That leads to a question. What changed this woman?

165
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:56,000
How did she move from? Only being concerned about herself in Chapter 2? And again, in chapter number 42, actually risking her own life. A very real risk to put in Action. A plan to save others.

166
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:13,000
well, perhaps she came to realize that that she was the one Who was to stand in the Gap and do what? No one else was in position to do know, God did not need Esther, but Esther had been elevated to this place at this time.

167
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,300
And So eventually she put the needs of others before.

168
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,800
Herself.

169
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:48,500
Now, some people believe that that Esther is a type of Christ. I don't necessarily Embrace that typology but I do think that there is initially a contrast between Esther and Jesus in that Esther initially was like, no, I'm not willing to get involved but Jesus Came to be involved.

170
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:31,600
We think not only of ourselves, but we think of the needs of other people and we placed their needs ahead of our own. Therefore, we live, and we serve God by serving others.

171
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,900
And this is what we see, then Esther doing.

172
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:49,200
After she was initially selfish in her response, she became selfless. And she realized that the needs of others far, superseded her own need to try to stay safe in the Kingdom.

173
00:37:50,800 --> 00:38:16,800
And so it's not about me anymore. It's about others. It's about putting my life on the line for others and I'm so thankful that I can stand up here today and I can tell you that, Jesus Christ, put his life on the line for us. When death was certain, he gave himself on the cross, not because he needed to die for anything that he had done, but he should die. So that we can be saved. He died in our place and for our sin.

174
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
But there's something else we need to see about Esther.

175
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:33,100
and it is this that Esther shows us that God gives us ability and intends that we use those abilities first purpose.

176
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
God is the one.

177
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,300
Who made Esther beautiful?

178
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,600
God is the one who gave Esther the personality that he gave her.

179
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,700
God is the one who allowed Mordecai to hear the plan.

180
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,300
Of the assassins.

181
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
God is the one who here.

182
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,000
Moved the king to show favor to Esther so that Esther could come forward.

183
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,200
And then she used the personality.

184
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,300
And the character traits that God had given her.

185
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,400
For God's purpose, not around.

186
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,800
Let me ask you.

187
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,000
Has God Made You skillful.

188
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,000
With anything.

189
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Maybe your skillful and Landscaping. Maybe your skillful in computer code. Maybe your skillful and word working. Maybe your skillful in housecleaning. Maybe your skillful in school. Whatever. God has made you skillful.

190
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,300
Has God.

191
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,300
Given you a great mind.

192
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,000
He's given you intelligence.

193
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Has God given you a personality that attracts people?

194
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,100
I don't have that personality, but some of you do,

195
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,500
Has God given you strength?

196
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,800
And internal fortitude.

197
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,600
A strong will spine of Steel.

198
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,200
Physical strength.

199
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,900
Has God Made You introverted.

200
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Here's the point.

201
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,800
However, God has made you and whatever God has given you.

202
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,200
Use it for his purpose.

203
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,600
All of it.

204
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,400
And by the way,

205
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,200
if God has made you a male,

206
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
Live as a male for his glory.

207
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,500
if God has made you a female live as a female for his glory,

208
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,100
here's the thing. God didn't make a mistake when he made you.

209
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,900
He didn't make a mistake when he created you to be who he desires you to be.

210
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,600
God does not mess up.

211
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,800
And we sit there and think, well, if I was only this or if I only had that then then, you know, I could really be used of God, that's wrong thinking.

212
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,600
Use whatever it is. God has given you.

213
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,700
For his purpose and be selfless as Christ was selfless.

214
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:08,800
When Esther understood the magnitude and effect of the difficulty that confronted her, we see here that Esther went from being self-centered to being selfless, and the second conclusion is that Haman was self-centered.

215
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:24,200
haman's, an interesting character and We'll spend a little bit of time, not a whole lot, but basically in verses 9 through 14, the author shows us a side of Haman that is quite familiar to us. Heyman was pretty much all about Heyman.

216
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:59,800
He just loved himself and you know what? After having been invited to a private dinner for the king with Esther and then before he got to leave that day, he heard that Esther was going to then produce a dinner, not just for the king. But for Haman the first is like, hey, you're an invited guest come and enjoy the benefit of my Feast. The second one is, hey, this Feast is just as much for you Heyman. Has it is for the king.

217
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:27,800
And Heyman, man. He left the palace that day. Happy, right. I mean, he walked outside of the the dining hall there and I could imagine that the sky was blue. And the Sun was shining bright and there was a cool breeze, perfect temperature. That day, the birds were tweeting. His Praises. Haman is great. Haman is great and he's like the I am it.

218
00:43:33,200 --> 00:44:18,200
He was filled with joy and that's really what Heyman lived for. He lived for Joy, he lived for his own personal happiness, at something that the author of this story wanted to make sure we understood because there's an inclusion here and inclusio in verse number 9. It says, at the beginning of this paragraph, that Haman went out that day, look at the word joyful and glad of Hearts, then drop down all the way to verse number 14, and you'll see after he receives the the advice from suresh's wife and his friends. It says As what then go, joyfully so joyful. As at the beginning joyful is it the end Haman was all about his happiness Haman was all about his Joy, whatever made him, happy, whatever made him joyful. That's what was important to him.

219
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:28,100
And everything was going fantastic for Hammond and till he walked to the gate and he sees Mordecai.

220
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,400
This insignificant little pests of a Jew.

221
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,700
Who won't even stand. There's no.

222
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,700
Way that Mordecai was going to genuflect for Heyman here at this point.

223
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,400
And it says that he didn't even Trimble. I can imagine Mordecai's thinking to himself or Heyman is thinking to himself, you know what?

224
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,200
I have turned the king's attention.

225
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:12,400
And purpose to issue an edict that's going to exterminate your life, it's not now, but at some point you're going to die and you still won't tremble in my presence. Don't you know who I am?

226
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:21,300
And notice how quickly Heyman went from joyful and glad of heart to being filled with Wrath.

227
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,300
Against Mordecai.

228
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:36,300
Here, he faces opposition and things didn't go the way he wanted them to go. And he was filled with wrath and he became extremely discontent.

229
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:50,800
You have to read this story with some imagination, right? Because this next part quite literally makes me laugh. Every time I read it,

230
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,700
Because Heyman.

231
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:02,400
The Magnificent one, he restrained himself. He didn't just reach out and take care of Mordecai at that moment. Most likely he was thinking your times coming.

232
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,000
I'll wait. But then he goes home and he's feeling pretty bad about himself at this point.

233
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,600
Everything was great and now it's terrible. All because the reaction of one, dude.

234
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:24,100
And notice what he does. He calls all of his friends together and calls his wife into the room and he starts talking about himself.

235
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,700
Haemon recounted to them the Splendor of his riches. Hey, do you know how rich I am?

236
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:43,200
You need to think for a moment about how much money I have and how little money you have. I'm richer than you, that's what's going on here.

237
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:52,000
And then he recounts to his wife. This part cracks me up to, he recounts to his wife, the number of sons. Like she didn't know.

238
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:02,000
I can imagine that he's, like, babe, we have this many sons and she's like, tell me about it.

239
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,700
I was there when I gave birth to them.

240
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:17,300
Basically what he's doing is, he's writing a Facebook post on steroids, right here. He's like look at me, look at me, look at me.

241
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:28,900
Instagram, praise me. Praise me. I'm worthy of Praise. My Little fragile ego is hurting because Mordecai hurt my feelings, but you need to praise me.

242
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,700
He says you know what, I've been promoted. Here's my medals.

243
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:59,900
Here's my pay stubs. As I've risen through the ranks above all, the other Servants of the king, and you know what, even The Queen Esther Made A Feast for The King, and I got invited to it today. And tomorrow, she's making a feast for us.

244
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,700
I am the greatest.

245
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:27,200
I can see in my mind, him recounting, all these things with just the biggest grin on his face, as he's talking about all of his possessions and all of his accomplishments. And all of the accolades that he's received and all of the honor that has been heaped upon him and then he stops for a minute. And he says,

246
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,900
But it all means nothing so long as Mordecai is alive.

247
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,000
It all means nothing.

248
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,800
As long as I see, Mordecai the Jew sitting at the Kings gate.

249
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,800
Discontentment carries a terrible cost, doesn't it?

250
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,000
Just Mordecai's.

251
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Presence.

252
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,800
Caused everything that was in Haman to come rushing out of him.

253
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,700
His pride.

254
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:19,800
Discontentment please note. This discontentment is always always without fail rooted in Pride.

255
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:33,900
And it's Pride that says, you know, what I deserve more. Yes. I I deserve everything that I've received, but you know what, I also deserve for that little Jew to respect me.

256
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,800
As long as he doesn't, none of this other stuff means anything to me.

257
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,600
Because he is not exalting me.

258
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,000
But discontentment is also rooted in gratitude.

259
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,800
And ingratitude reveals that we think we're responsible for what we have.

260
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:10,700
And when these two things come together, it ensures that satisfaction is a goal. Post that is constantly moving away from you.

261
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,100
You do the same thing, don't you?

262
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,300
We're actually more like Haman in the story than what we like to admit.

263
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:49,300
You know what? God has been so good to me. I have, I have so many things. I've got a wonderful home, and I've got my health, and I've got my family and I've got some money saved away. And I've got a job that I enjoy and I just have so many things, but you know, what? I won't be. Truly satisfied until I get Blank, whatever.

264
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,800
If we make things the object of Our Lives, then we're continually going to be discontent.

265
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:27,800
We're more like Haman in the story than we like to admit Haman. Was an idolater in his Idol as revealed was public respect. He wanted everyone to acknowledge his greatness and when someone didn't do, what he demanded the idol of his heart was challenged and he was angry and discontent.

266
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,100
No wonder the Apostle Paul said that godliness with contentment is great gain.

267
00:51:38,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And thankfully the gospel freeze. Those who have come to faith in Christ from craving, the approval of people. Why? Because you have been loved and accepted by God, you don't need the world to revolve around you. When you realize that God is actually at the center of everything and you are not when you realize that everything is about, God not about you and this is the opposite of the advice that Haman received The advice Heyman received his do whatever you have to do to be happy. And if that is building a Gallows, 50 feet, high or 50 cubits high and and hanging Mordecai on it, then so be it. That's what you got to do. Then do it and be joyful. Now because you've gotten that one thing that stops you from enjoying everything else, but you know what had he hung Mordecai than he would have been upset about something else? This revealed The orientation of his heart.

268
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,200
So we see this truth in both Esther and Haman.

269
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:55,400
So, my question to you, is this To whom, do you turn when life is difficult?

270
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,700
But Heyman turned to himself.

271
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,600
And to those who would feed his ego.

272
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,700
Esther was humble and selfless.

273
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,000
Haman was arrogant.

274
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,900
And self-centered.

275
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,800
So when difficulties arise in your life, do you turn to God?

276
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,800
Or do you turn to self?

277
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,800
And then, as I think about this in a larger picture,

278
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,400
I see really a beautiful truth here.

279
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,700
Esther had to go to a King and she hoped that he would accept her.

280
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:10,600
And she hoped that he would listen and she hoped that he would do what she asked him to do that. She that he would provide Deliverance for her and for her people.

281
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:27,100
But you know what, as Believers is, those who are in Christ, we need to see really something beautiful. And that is this that we have a greater King to turn to and he bids us to come into him.

282
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:51,100
And to everyone who comes to this King through faith, in his son, then this king is a an Ever present help in time of trouble. He is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. He is a friend who has promised never to leave you or to forsake you You don't have to ever be worried about being turned away from this King.

283
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,600
Our King knows everything.

284
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,500
Our King sees everything. Our King is all wives.

285
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:46,400
So when difficulties arise, listen, brother and sister, if you are in Christ, if you were saved, you have access provided to you to this King. So turn to him and trust him and look to him for the help that only he can provide to you the psalmist. Put it this way. I lift my eyes to the hills from. Whence does come my help.

286
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,300
My help comes from the Lord who made Heaven and Earth.

287
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,200
We have a better King.

288
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,700
Than any Earthly King.

289
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,200
And we can approach him.

290
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,600
But the orientation of our heart must be humble and selfless.

291
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Not arrogant and self-centered.

292
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,300
Let me ask you one final question. I'm done.

293
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,100
Do you see difficulties as an opportunity to trust, God, and grow in Salvation?

294
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,600
That's what they're there for.

295
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,300
God is not some.

296
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,800
Vindictive person.

297
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,800
Who loves to inflict pain on people.

298
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:48,100
There's a purpose for the difficulties that we face in the scripture tells us clearly that the difficulties we as his people face are used for our good.

299
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,800
To make us more christ-like and ultimately for his purpose.

300
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,900
Difficulties reveal the orientation of your heart.

301
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,300
What is, what are the difficulties you go through reveal about you?

302
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,500
Father, thank you.

303
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,600
For the truth of your word. Thank you for hard truths.

304
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,300
Lord. Today, I've done the the best that I can do.

305
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,000
To open your word, to explain it to your people.

306
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,100
So that they might understand and apply it.

307
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:49,600
I thank you that you are our great king who can be approached in the Lord that we have the right to approach you not because of anything that we've done. But because our faith is in a crucified Risen, Savior, your son, whose blood made it possible for us to come boldly before your throne, and to make our petitions known.

308
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:08,500
Lord, I pray. If there are those in this audience today, those who are watching online, even who have never put their faith and trust in you Lord, perhaps they think that they can approach you by themselves that they don't need to put all of their hope and confidence in the work of another that they think.

309
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,500
Wrongly.

310
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:20,600
That you can be impressed by the things that they do in the way that they do them. Lord, I pray that you would open their eyes to the fallacy of that thinking.

311
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:55,800
Lord that they would realize and understand that there is nothing they can do to impress you. There's nothing that they can do to earn a place in your presence, Lord, that they might turn to Christ in faith. Believing that Jesus is your son that he was sinless that he died on the cross in their place for their sin and that he's risen from the dead and inputting their faith and trust and hope in him. Lord, you will save them. You'll make them a new creation. Father, you we'll adopt them and bring them into the family and you Lord.

312
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,900
An Ever present help in time of trouble.

313
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
You are a great king.

314
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,100
Who we love and serve.

315
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:19,600
Father, I pray that you would help us to see the purpose of our difficulties that you might be glorified in them for if we pray it in Jesus name. Amen, let's stand it worship.
