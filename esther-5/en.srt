00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Find if you would Esther chapter 5, the fifth chapter of the book of Esther. You know, some might

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:15,040
 look at the story of Esther and see only a series of coincidences. Well, you know, it's just a

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,600
 coincidence that the king and a drunken stupor would call out to the queen Vashty and insist that

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,880
 she present herself in front of himself and other drunken men in a way that would degrade the

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,240
 office of queen and therefore she said that she would not come and she was eventually deposed

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,400
 because of that action which then opened the door for a new queen. We might look and say, well,

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,920
 you know, it's just a coincidence that Mordekai and Esther remained in Susa. It's just a coincidence

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,000
 that Esther would have found favor in the eyes of those to whom she was responsible and

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,760
 that she would eventually find favor in the eyes of the king and be elevated to the role of queen.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,760
 Some would say it's just a coincidence that Mordekai, the Jew, was in the gate when he overheard

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,520
 two of the king's guards discussing a plot to assassinate the king, which he was then able to go

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,640
 until Esther and Esther told the king and the plot was discovered and stopped sparing the life

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,840
 of Ahashwaris. Some would say, well, it was just a coincidence that Haiman was promoted for reasons

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,040
 that are never revealed to us in the narrative of Esther. But eventually he was put into position

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,760
 whereby he could convince the king to issue an order calling for the extermination of all the Jews

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,920
 in the Persian Empire. Just a lot of coincidences. It was just a coincidence that Esther then was

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,520
 in position to be able to potentially do something to help. A lot of coincidences.

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,560
 But what if I told you that there really is no such thing as coincidence?

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:29,040
 What if I told you that, you know, coincidences is something that we think of. It's a term that we think in,

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,200
 but coincidence doesn't truly exist like we think it does. Yet it's part of our lexicon.

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,840
 It's part of the lexicon of our lives. We constantly talk about coincidences. If you were to go to

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,960
 the store today and meet somebody that you hadn't seen since you were in high school or in college,

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,840
 you would think, wow, what a coincidence that we are together in the same store at the same time

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,880
 walking down the same aisle and we came together today. We think of and we speak in terms of

25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,200
 coincidence, but there's no such thing as coincidence. What if I told you that there are times when

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,800
 God brings difficulties that are not coincidental, but God brings difficulties and those difficulties serve

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,560
 a greater purpose than you might understand. Look with me in Esther chapter number five beginning

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:32,400
 in verse number one. On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
 the King's palace and front of the King's quarters while the King was sitting on his royal throne

30
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,560
 inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace. Now you're going to see here in verse number

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,280
 one the repetition of the word royal. She put on her royal robes. He was sitting on his royal throne

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,400
 inside the palace. The intent of the author is to paint a picture for us that these people

33
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,280
 were not hanging out in some ordinary place doing something ordinary. This is something extraordinary.

34
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,800
 This is something outside the realm of what we would consider normal for ourselves that this is

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,160
 situated, that this is set in an extraordinary place during an extraordinary time and we see people

36
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,720
 who are extraordinary in human perspective but just ordinary creations of God as we look at it from a

37
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,400
 divine perspective. Look at verse number two and when the King saw Esther standing in the court she

38
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,080
 won favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand then Esther

39
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,280
 approached and touched the tip of the scepter and the King said to her what is it Queen Esther?

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,120
 What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of my kingdom. And Esther said if it

41
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
 pleased the King let the King and Hayman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the King

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,320
 then the King said bring Hayman quickly so that we may do as Esther has asked so the King and Hayman

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,600
 came to the feast that Esther had prepared and as they were drinking wine after the feast the King

44
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,560
 said to Esther what is your wish? It shall be granted you and what is your request even to half the

45
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,680
 of my kingdom it shall be fulfilled then Esther answered my wish and my request is

46
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,600
 if I have found favor in the sight of the King and if it pleased the King to grant my wish and

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,400
 fulfill my request let the King do is the King and Hayman come to the feast that I will prepare for

48
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,680
 them and tomorrow I will do as the King has said and Hayman went out that day joyful and glad of heart

49
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,240
 but when Hayman saw Mordekai in the King's gate that he neither rose nor trembled before him

50
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,280
 he was filled with wrath against Mordekai. Nevertheless Hayman restrained himself and went home

51
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,400
 and sent and brought his friends and his wife Zerash and Hayman recounted to them the splendor of his

52
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,280
 riches the number of his sons all the promotions with which the King had honored him and how he had

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,760
 advanced him above the officials and the servants of the King then Hayman said even Queen Esther let

54
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:21,200
 no one but me come with the King to the feast she prepared and tomorrow also I am invited by her

55
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:30,080
 together with the King yet all of this is worth nothing to me as long as I see Mordekai the Jew

56
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,000
 sitting in the King's gate then his wife Zerash and all his friends said to him let a gallows 50

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,880
 cubits high be made and in the morning tell the King to have Mordekai hanged upon it then go joyfully

58
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:52,800
 with the King to the feast this idea please Taman and he had the gallows made Lord God you're good to

59
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:02,240
 us in gathering us together in a place where we can freely open your word read it hear it proclaimed

60
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:14,320
 and explained father we know that we required divine aid to understand it and to apply it

61
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:24,400
 and so God I pray that you would give that aid now that we would see this not just as a story that

62
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:34,640
 took place a long time ago in a land far away but Lord that we might understand the purpose

63
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:44,240
 for which you have given this to us and that it might impact our lives Lord I pray that you would

64
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:52,960
 enable us to see clearly that which needs to be seen and understood and applied for your glory

65
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,960
 for the greater purpose that you have for our lives as your people so father open our eyes help us to

66
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:09,440
 see and understand we pray it in Jesus name amen you know God often allows difficulties to expose the

67
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,560
 orientation of your heart that's one of the things that we see in this text we see a time in the

68
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,040
 history of the Jews that was exceedingly difficult they were in fact looking at and facing not just

69
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,240
 the possibility of extinction but the promise of extinction for nothing that they had done truly

70
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,280
 this whole thing comes back to the reality that Mordecai made Hayman mad and Hayman instead of just

71
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:47,280
 simply trying to deal with the problem by dealing with one man has said no no no that's not enough

72
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,120
 someone like me needs to make a bigger splash and so I'm going to make sure that all of the Jews in

73
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,760
 the entire kingdom pay for what this one man has done it's a time of great difficulty and I know

74
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,280
 that we typically speak in the language of coincidence but C.S. Lewis attribute is attributed to

75
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,040
 have said coincidence as God's way of remaining anonymous you know God's name is not mentioned

76
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,600
 throughout this book and yet we see that God is on every page that God is the one who is moving

77
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,080
 all of the pieces that God is the one who is sovereignly and carefully behind the scenes

78
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,920
 orchestrating every act to bring about his greater purpose he is orchestrating every move to do that

79
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,240
 which he is determined to do to deliver his people from annihilation and thereby fulfill the

80
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:49,360
 promise that may he made to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and our sovereign God the same God who is

81
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,600
 working behind the scenes in the story of Esther that same God is just as sovereign today as he was

82
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 when this event was taking place that same God is just as sovereign today as he has ever been he

83
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,240
 is sovereign he remains sovereign and he will often don't miss this he will often allow difficulties

84
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:18,800
 to assail you because he wants to expose you to the orientation of your heart he wants to pull

85
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,760
 back the curtain so that you can see how your heart is oriented and one of the ways he does that

86
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:37,680
 is by bringing us into difficult situations and scenarios now from a human perspective

87
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,280
 we don't like the sovereignty of God and let me tell you why we don't like the sovereignty of God

88
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:56,560
 because if God is sovereign that means we're not right and and we don't like the idea of someone

89
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:05,920
 other than ourselves being in control I don't like to ride with anybody in a car I'm serious I don't

90
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
 when my kids were learning how to drive scared the fire out of me why because I'm not the one behind

91
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:19,920
 the wheel therefore I didn't teach them how to drive I let Rebecca do it and I would ride with

92
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:32,160
 them right before they took the test I like to feel as though I'm in control and when I'm reminded

93
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,360
 from the truth of God's word that I am not in control in any way it doesn't always sit well with me

94
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,840
 just a minute ago you all sang to the top of your lungs we will trust in you

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,800
 perfect savior strong defender we will trust in you you know what it's really really really

96
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:07,760
 really easy to sing those words isn't it it's an entirely different thing when we are put into a

97
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:19,360
 situation whereby we must actually trust him when we realize that we truly have no control what

98
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,960
 so ever and the only thing that we can do is to step back and say okay God I have to trust you

99
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,520
 with my child I have to trust you with my spouse I have to trust you with my finances I have to

100
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,880
 trust you with fill in the blank oh standing among a group of believers listening to beautiful

101
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,600
 music being played by the band and singing out we will trust in you that is so easy but when

102
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 you actually have to do it you have to acknowledge the truth that God is the sovereign one and that you

103
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,360
 are not and because we don't like the sovereignty of God we begin to look at things and the things that

104
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,160
 people do specifically and the things that happen in the world around us and and we begin to

105
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,760
 declare that that God can't be sovereign in the way that scripture defines sovereignty and

106
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,680
 declares sovereignty why because if God is sovereign then why are all of these terrible things

107
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,760
 happening around us why do we see so many sinful things playing out on the stage in front of us if

108
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,680
 God is truly sovereign and control of everything then surely he could stop these bad things from happening

109
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,480
 listen God's sovereignty and human responsibility are not in competition against one another

110
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:55,520
 the men and women in this story they were not being controlled as passive figures

111
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:07,920
 when I was a kid I loved GI Joe and Transformers I would get home from school and I would watch

112
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,320
 really three cartoons Scooby-Doo Amen right I may not get another amen the rest of the time from

113
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:25,040
 some of you but I said Scooby-Doo and you're like preach it brother um transformers and GI Joe

114
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,120
 and I would get GI Joe toys and transform transformers toys and for Christmas and for my birthday and

115
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:43,040
 and I would play with those toys the crazy thing about it is that when I laid those toys down on

116
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,240
 the ground they didn't pick themselves up and positioned themselves in battle ready positions right

117
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,600
 toy story is fake it's just a cartoon they don't really do that and if I left them on the ground

118
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,720
 and walked away then when I came back they would be right where they were in the position in which I

119
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,360
 left them I had to act upon them I had to move their arms and their legs and their head I had to

120
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,640
 transform Optimus from semi-mode to robot mode I had to do that and we sit there and think that

121
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,600
 the sovereignty of God is much like that that God is pulling all of the strings that we're just

122
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 animatrons and and we're puppets and and we are moved into position and and we do things just

123
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,200
 according to the way he wants them to be done and that is a simplistic view of the sovereignty of God

124
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,720
 we see here that God is is behind everything that is taking place and that God is orchestrating

125
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,480
 everything that is taking place every move that is made every step that is taken that sounds like

126
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,920
 that song right every move you make every step you take I don't know why I went there but it's just

127
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:01,520
 in my head we think that okay he did this and he did that and so God caused this and God did this

128
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,680
 listen God is behind everything that is going on but he is also working through

129
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:17,120
 the actions of the people involved in the narrative these people were not compelled to act contrary

130
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
 to their wills but God worked through their actions to accomplish his purposes Peter

131
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,160
 described this for us when he preached on Pentecost talking about Christ he said this Jesus delivered

132
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,520
 up according to the definite plan and for knowledge of God you crucified and killed by the hands

133
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 of lawless men it was God's purpose for Christ to come and to live and to die on the cross this

134
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,000
 was set in motion before the very foundation of the world but yet God used the sinful actions of

135
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,440
 human beings as the tools whereby what God had willed to happen actually took place make sense

136
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,680
 and that's what we see happening here God is behind the scenes God purposes what is going to take

137
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,760
 place and yet he uses the actions the good and even the sinful actions of the people involved to

138
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,080
 accomplish that purpose one author said God achieves his perfect goals not just through our best

139
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:27,360
 intentions and most self-sacrificing acts but even through our greatest sins and compromises

140
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
 now maybe that's not something that brings comfort to you but as a sinner that brings great comfort

141
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,480
 to me I'm glad to know that my sinful acts don't re-derail the plan and purpose of God

142
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,960
 but God is so great and so powerful and so sovereign that he can take even the sinful things that I do

143
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:58,560
 and turn them and use those to accomplish his purpose and glory and sometimes because of our actions

144
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,640
 and sometimes because of nothing that we've done God who is sovereign and control of all things

145
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,040
 brings difficulties but God sees to it and here's what I don't want you to miss God sees to it

146
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:20,960
 that for his people the purpose of those difficulties is never ever wasted in other words we don't

147
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:30,800
 just go through hard times to go through hard times God is not some sadistic vindictive being who is

148
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 up there thinking you know what how can I make them suffer how can I make life difficult just

149
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:46,400
 because I can no for the believer every single thing helps to accomplish the purpose of God in us

150
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:56,080
 and in the world and so what do the difficulties of life accomplish how how to difficulties expose

151
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,920
 the the orientation of the heart well this story does not provide for us an exhaustive list of the

152
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,040
 ways that God uses difficulties to accomplish things in our life but there are two conclusions that

153
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,120
 we can draw from the difficulties presented in this chapter the first is this that Esther when

154
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:28,640
 difficulty came became selfless now the author shows us in chapter five the Esther we've come to know

155
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:37,360
 from chapter two so if you remember the flow of the story Esther was not seen in chapter one she

156
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:45,440
 comes into onto the scene in chapter two whereby she's elevated to the role and office of queen she's

157
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,720
 not seen again in chapter number three she enters the scene a second time in chapter four and then

158
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,040
 the first part of the narrative in chapter five is really focused on this woman Esther and some

159
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,880
 of the things that we see in chapter five are the same things that we saw about her in chapter two

160
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 so we see essentially the same person however we see the same person who is now using who she is not

161
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:23,200
 for her own selfish ends but for a selfless purpose so just to bring you up to speed on what's going

162
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,800
 on here at the end of chapter number four Esther had learned the plan of Hayman he she had learned the

163
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,240
 edict that had been sent out throughout the kingdom that all of the Jews were going to be annihilated

164
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:44,000
 that all of the Jews were going to be killed and the destruction was complete that it was exhaustive

165
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,560
 that if this plan was carried out not one single Jew would be alive in the entire Persian kingdom

166
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,120
 she had no idea that that was even a thing she was just living in the walls of the palace going

167
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,400
 on about her luxurious life and then she heard from Mordecai that this thing had happened and her

168
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,520
 initial reaction if you remember was in essence wow that sounds really really bad sorry

169
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,360
 if I go to the king and try to talk to the king about this unannounced I could lose my own life

170
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:33,200
 that's not really part of my plan and so good luck that's essentially what we see in chapter four

171
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:41,600
 and then Mordecai sends another message to her and the other message is this okay Esther

172
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:49,360
 you know what you think you're safe in the palace they know you're a Jew now and so you're not

173
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,760
 actually safe there any more than what we are outside of the palace but we know that deliverance

174
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,360
 for the Jews is going to come from some other place you and your father's house are going to die

175
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,120
 but maybe just maybe who knows is the language given to us in chapter four who knows if you have

176
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:18,480
 attained this position in the kingdom for such a time as this for this purpose to do something

177
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:28,960
 about the situation and to that Esther responded okay we're going to fast for three days myself

178
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:36,560
 and my maids and tell all of the Jewish people to fast for three days and then I will go in and break

179
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:46,720
 the law and see the king and if I perish I perish I might lose my life for this and if I do at least

180
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:55,840
 I died for something doing something instead of doing nothing so we come to chapter five

181
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:07,120
 and we see some really laudable characteristics of Esther that she employed in chapter two

182
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,240
 to ascend to the throne and now she's using them for a greater higher purpose notice

183
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,320
 what it says about her on the third day what does it tell us it tells us that Esther was prepared

184
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,360
 it tells us that she took the responsibility of of going before the king to present the petition to

185
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,200
 save the people very seriously so much so that she fasted for three days now some people like to say

186
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,080
 that prayer is implied in the fasting but the narrative the text doesn't actually say that prayer

187
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,680
 is took place that prayer happened and so we're just going to act like because it's not in the text it's

188
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,040
 not really something that should guide our thinking maybe she prayed we don't know we do know that

189
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,720
 she fasted and that fasting was most likely a time to prepare herself physically mentally and maybe

190
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:11,200
 even spiritually to take a huge risk to go before the king without being invited

191
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:19,120
 and so she prepared herself much like she prepared herself to go into the king the first time in

192
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:27,120
 chapter number two she was prepared notice what else she put on royal robes she was thoughtful

193
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,040
 she understood that you know what I'm not going to Walmart and my pajamas and crocs

194
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,880
 why do people go to Walmart and pajamas and crocs I don't understand that if anybody can explain

195
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:49,440
 that to me I would maybe like to hear that maybe not I don't know but she she knew that she had a

196
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,560
 serious responsibility a serious job so what did she do she put on the robes of royalty

197
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:10,240
 she put on her queenly garments the finest in the kingdom she put the crown on her head

198
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:21,040
 she prepared herself to gain an audience with the king something to be said about preparation

199
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,080
 she prepared and she was thoughtful much like she was in chapter two when she said what is it

200
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:38,880
 that the king likes what is it that I can do then we see that she stood in the inner court

201
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:50,960
 and that she waited to be acknowledged now she clearly didn't go into the throne room because

202
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,240
 had she gone into the throne room the king this is verified by historical documents the king

203
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,080
 would have had behind him a couple of guys one maybe two wielding axes and so if she had just

204
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,560
 rushed right into the throne room one of those guys would have just flew and taken off her head

205
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,360
 no one was allowed to go into the king's presence without being invited first so what did she do

206
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,440
 instead of thinking that she because she's the queen had a right to do what nobody else could do

207
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,360
 no she she got to where she was within his line of sight and maybe I don't know this is speculation

208
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,640
 perhaps the light hit a jewel in her crown in such a way or a jewel that she was wearing in such a

209
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,800
 way that the light refracted off of that and and the king's eye and he turned his attention to

210
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:48,240
 see her and when he saw her what did he do he held out the scepter which then allowed her to come

211
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,840
 into his presence and she came in and she did so not rushing into his presence not with bravado

212
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,920
 not with any kind of arrogance but she came in humbly and she touched the scepter

213
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:15,120
 and she said if it pleased the king she understood her role she understood her position

214
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:29,360
 and she exercised great humility and then she went to work and what we see in the rest of this half

215
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:37,280
 of the narrative is really Esther executing a plan that she had thought through very well

216
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:47,120
 well she was skillful in what she did and how she did it she said if it pleased the king

217
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:56,960
 let the king and hamin why not just the king why hamin too because she knows what she's doing

218
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
 one of the things that we can tell about Esther from the narrative is that she evidently had

219
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,880
 a propensity and ability to read people as she knew how to put people into places so that

220
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,560
 the maximum of effect and benefit would would take place meeting with the king alone wasn't the

221
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,560
 goal no she wanted hamin to be there as well and so she says come to the feast today that I

222
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:33,760
 prepared for you the king so the king then calls out bring hamin he's got to come so we can go

223
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,800
 together quickly to meet with the queen and have dinner and so they had dinner and then they were

224
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,120
 drinking and then the king says to Esther a second time what is it that you want so this tells us

225
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,080
 that the king knew and understood that Esther wanted something it wasn't that she just wanted to

226
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,560
 prepare a meal for him she wanted something he knew that now he's a pretty ignorant foolish guy

227
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:02,960
 but he was able to pick up on this so she must have been dropping some pretty hefty hints

228
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:14,720
 what is your wish it shall be granted you what is your request even to half my kingdom it shall be

229
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:23,120
 fulfilled now half my kingdom was hyperbole he wasn't planning on giving up half the kingdom what

230
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,040
 he was telling Esther is this I have the power to give you what you ask what you ask for trust me

231
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,480
 all you have to do is ask what is it that you want

232
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:52,320
 so she continues my wish and my request is now in the Hebrew it seems as almost if there should

233
00:29:52,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 be an ellipsis here dot dot dot there's a pause my wish is some people speculate that she lost

234
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,360
 her nerve here that she was fully planning on saying listen Heyman has convinced you to kill all

235
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 of my people I need you to rescind that order but I don't think that's what's going on here

236
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:28,560
 I think what's happening is she's skillfully fishing let me explain

237
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:36,800
 she's put the the bait on the hook she's cast the lure out into the water and she's pulling it in

238
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,440
 and and maybe just as the king gets a little bit close she yanks it a little bit and peaks the

239
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,000
 king's interest just a little bit more and and then she starts reeling it in more and the king

240
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,360
 is coming closer and closer and and he's just about ready to take a nibble and she yanks it again

241
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,160
 and she's trying to set it just in the right position so at the right time the king bites

242
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,760
 and then she can make a request known she says as much here she says listen come to a feast tomorrow

243
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,160
 that I'm going to prepare for them not notice something in verse number four she said I prepared a

244
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:30,960
 feast for the king but down in verse number eight she says that she's prepared the the feast for

245
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,960
 she will prepare the feast for them the king and Heyman well Heyman is like wow you're preparing a

246
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:48,800
 feast for me and then she says this tomorrow I will do as the king has said I'll tell you tomorrow

247
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:56,960
 I want to think you have to understand here is this is a this is a complex issue and it's a

248
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,400
 risky issue what she's asking the king what she will ask the king to do is no small thing that's why

249
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:11,360
 I believe she didn't just barge right in and just blab right out right she was skillfully working

250
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:20,080
 the problem to achieve the desired end the story is told of Alexander the great who marched

251
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:27,680
 his army into Turkey and he was shown the knot of Gordius and the knot of Gordius was a knot

252
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,080
 that was so huge and so complex that it was humanly impossible and tie but the legend was any man

253
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:41,280
 who could successfully untie the knot would rule over all of Asia so when Alexander the great

254
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,200
 and his troops marched into Turkey he was introduced to and presented the knot of Gordius and he was

255
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,080
 told the story and so he began to mess with the knot the story goes for a few minutes became

256
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,800
 frustrated as everybody was watching him fail at untying this knot and he essentially thought you

257
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,520
 know what it doesn't say how it needs to be untied he took his sword and hacked the knot to pieces

258
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,320
 so that it fell apart right in front of everybody Esther could not take such a simplistic approach

259
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,840
 why because there was something called the law of the Meeds and the Persians the law of the Meeds and

260
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,080
 the Persians was irrevocable when a Persian king set forth a law that law could not be rescinded

261
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,480
 even by the king's own order Daniel was familiar with this why because when Darius the Persian king

262
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,640
 enacted a law said no one can work pray to anybody but you for the next 30 days and Daniel did it

263
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,880
 the king regrettably threw Daniel into the lion's den why because he had to follow his own law

264
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:51,440
 and for a Persian king to fail to follow his own law would be a self admitting failure that he

265
00:33:51,440 --> 00:34:00,640
 himself did not have the strength the power the force to execute his own word and so Esther

266
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,480
 coming along saying listen you need to write off this law so that the Jews aren't killed it would

267
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:16,000
 have made the king look unbelievably bad feckless powerless in front of his people so Esther needed

268
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,360
 to manufacture to do things in such a way that there'd be very very hard for the king to wiggle out of

269
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:35,840
 a promise that he's made so follow along Esther what is your wish you will have it Esther what is your

270
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:45,920
 wish you will have it up to half of my kingdom tomorrow i'll tell you king Esther what is your

271
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:53,440
 wish three times the king will have promised to give Esther what she's looking for Esther is a smart girl

272
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,960
 she knows what she's doing she's putting the king into a position where it would be almost

273
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:15,840
 impossible for him to deny her request and so we see Esther many of the same traits on display in

274
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,840
 chapter five with which she won favor in the eyes of all who saw her in chapter two and eventually

275
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,800
 won the grace and favor of the king these things are once again on display she's prepared she's

276
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,960
 thoughtful she's humble she's skillfully executing her plan only this time she worked to help others

277
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:44,240
 instead of herself and that leads to a question what changed this woman how did she move from

278
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,840
 only being concerned about herself in chapter two and again in chapter number four to actually

279
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:57,840
 risking her own life a very real risk to to put in action a plan to save others well perhaps she

280
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,960
 came to realize that that she was the one who was to stand in the gap and do what no one else was

281
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,720
 in position to do no God did not need Esther but Esther had been elevated to this place at this time

282
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:25,760
 for this purpose and so eventually she put the needs of others before herself now some people

283
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,520
 believe that that Esther is a type of Christ I don't necessarily embrace that type of

284
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:41,760
 biology but I do think that there is initially a contrast between Esther and Jesus in that

285
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,240
 Esther initially was like no I'm not willing to get involved but Jesus came to be involved

286
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,800
 that he came to seek and save those who are lost that that Jesus is the one who came not for his

287
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,320
 own purpose and not for his own glory but he came to do the will of the Father and the book of

288
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,600
 Philippians tells us that Jesus obeyed the will of the Father and became obedient to the place of

289
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,600
 death or the point of death even death on the cross and earlier in the text Paul says that brothers

290
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,400
 and sisters are to deal with each other in the same way in the church that we're going to have the

291
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,000
 same mind in us and what is that mindset that we think not only of ourselves but we think of the

292
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,360
 needs of other people and we place their needs ahead of our own therefore we live and we serve

293
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:39,840
 God by serving others and this is what we see then Esther doing after she was initially selfish

294
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,840
 in her response she became selfless and she realized that the needs of others far super seated

295
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:53,840
 her own need to try to stay safe in the kingdom and so it's not about me anymore it's about others

296
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,200
 it's about putting my life on the line for others and I'm so thankful that I can stand up here today

297
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:06,000
 and I can tell you that Jesus Christ put his life on the line for us when death was certain

298
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,920
 he gave himself on the cross not because he needed to die for anything that he had done but he

299
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:20,960
 should die so that we can be saved he died in our place and for our sin but there's something

300
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:29,280
 else we need to see about Esther and it is this that Esther shows us that God gives us ability

301
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:37,680
 and intends that we use those abilities for his purpose just think through this text with me again

302
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,080
 God is the one who made Esther beautiful

303
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,400
 God is the one who gave Esther the personality that he gave her

304
00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:00,960
 God is the one who allowed Mordeky to hear the plan of the assassins

305
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:11,680
 God is the one who here moved the king to show favor to Esther so that Esther could come forward

306
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,080
 and then she used the personality and the character traits that God had given her

307
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,160
 for God's purpose not her own

308
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,720
 let me ask you has God made you skillful with anything

309
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:44,720
 maybe you're skillful in landscaping maybe you're skillful in computer code maybe you're skillful

310
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:52,640
 in wordworking maybe you're skillful in house cleaning maybe you're skillful in school whatever God

311
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:06,640
 has made you skillful has God given you a great mind he's given you intelligence

312
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,680
 has God given you a personality that attracts people I don't have that personality but some of you do

313
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:33,920
 has God given you strength an internal fortitude a strong will a spine of steel physical strength

314
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:45,280
 has God made you introverted here's the point

315
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:57,840
 however God has made you and whatever God has given you use it for his purpose

316
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:16,560
 all of it and by the way if God has made you a male live as a male for his glory if God has

317
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,360
 made you a female live as a female for his glory here's the thing God didn't make a mistake when

318
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,680
 he made you he didn't make a mistake when he created you to be who he desires you to be

319
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,160
 God does not mess up and we sit there and think well if I was only this or if I only had that then

320
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:47,360
 then you know I could really be used of God that's wrong thinking use whatever it is God has given you

321
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,320
 for his purpose and be selfless as Christ was selfless

322
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,120
 when Esther understood the magnitude and effect of the difficulty that confronted her we see here

323
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:07,200
 that Esther went from being self-centered to being selfless and the second conclusion is that

324
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,920
 Heyman was self-centered and Heyman's an interesting character and we'll spend a little bit of time

325
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,440
 not a whole lot but basically in verses 9 through 14 the author shows us a side of Heyman that is

326
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,520
 quite familiar to us Heyman was pretty much all about Heyman his name means one who is magnificent

327
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,280
 and there was nobody who thought Heyman was more magnificent than Heyman himself he just loved

328
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,520
 himself and you know what after having been invited to a private dinner for the king with Esther

329
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:46,640
 and then before he got to leave that day he heard that Esther was going to then produce a dinner

330
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,600
 not just for the king but for Heyman the first is like hey you're an invited guest come and enjoy

331
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,120
 the benefit of my feast the second one is hey this feast is just as much for you Heyman as it is for

332
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:10,800
 the king and Heyman man he left the palace that day happy right I mean he walked outside of the

333
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,240
 dining hall there and I could imagine that the the sky was blue and the sun was shining bright

334
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,400
 and there was a cool breeze perfect temperature that day the birds were tweeting his praises Heyman

335
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,280
 is great Heyman is great he's like I am it

336
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,800
 he was filled with joy and that's really what Heyman lived for he lived for joy he lived for his

337
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,160
 own personal happiness it's something that the author of this story wanted to make sure we understood

338
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,720
 because there's an inclusion here in Ecclusio in verse number nine it says at the beginning of

339
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,880
 this paragraph that Heyman went out that day look at the word joyful and glad of heart then drop

340
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,040
 down all the way to verse number 14 and you'll see after he receives the the advice from Zoresha's

341
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,160
 wife and his friends it says what then go joyfully so joyful is it the beginning joyful is at the end

342
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,280
 Heyman was all about his happiness Heyman was all about his joy whatever made him happy whatever made

343
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:24,160
 him joyful that's what was important to him no matter the cost and everything was going fantastic

344
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:34,080
 for Heyman until he walked to the gate and he sees Mordecai this insignificant little pest of a Jew

345
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:44,800
 who won't even stand there's no way that Mordecai was going to to genio fleck for Heyman here at

346
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,920
 this point and it says that he didn't even tremble I can imagine Mordecai is thinking to himself

347
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,920
 or Heyman is thinking to himself you know what I have turned the king's attention

348
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:05,920
 and purpose to issue an edict that's going to exterminate your life it's not now but at some point

349
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,160
 you're going to die and and you still won't tremble in my presence don't you know who I am

350
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:20,880
 and notice how quickly Heyman went from joyful and glad of heart to being filled with wrath

351
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:31,120
 against Mordecai here he faces opposition and things didn't go the way he wanted them to go and he

352
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:44,560
 was filled with wrath and he became extremely discontent you have to read this story with some

353
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,560
 imagination right because this next part quite literally makes me laugh every time I read it

354
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,800
 because Heyman the magnificent one he restrained himself he didn't just reach out and take care

355
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,440
 of Mordecai at that moment most likely he was thinking your time's coming I'll wait but then he

356
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,000
 goes home and he's feeling pretty bad about himself at this point everything was great now it's

357
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,920
 terrible all because the reaction of one dude and notice what he does he calls all of his friends

358
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,920
 together and calls his wife into the room and he starts talking about himself

359
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:32,400
 Heyman recounted to them the splendor of his riches hey do you know how rich I am

360
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,960
 you need to think for a moment about how much money I have and how little money you have

361
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:47,120
 I'm richer than you that's what's going on here and then he he he recounts to his wife this

362
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,760
 part cracks me up to he recounts to his wife the number of sons like she didn't know

363
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,760
 I can imagine that he's like babe we have this many sons and she's like oh tell me about it

364
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,480
 I was there when I gave birth to them

365
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,200
 basically what he's doing is he's writing a Facebook post on steroids right here he's like look

366
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,800
 at me look at me look at me

367
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,760
 Instagram praise me praise me I'm worthy of praise my little fragile ego is hurting because

368
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,720
 Mordecai hurt my feelings but you need to praise me

369
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,440
 he says you know what I've been promoted here's my medals

370
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:46,000
 here's my paste-ups as I've risen through the ranks above all the other surfants of the king

371
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,120
 and you know what even the queen Esther made a feast for the king and I got invited to it today

372
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,360
 and tomorrow she's making a feast for us

373
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
 I

374
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
 am the greatest

375
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,200
 I can see in my mind him recounting all these things with just the biggest grin on his face as

376
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,840
 he's talking about all of his possessions and all of his accomplishments and all of the

377
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,040
 accolades that he's received and all of the honor that has been heaped upon him and then

378
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,880
 he stops for a minute and he says

379
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,560
 but it all means nothing so long as Mordecai is alive

380
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:45,600
 it all means nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate

381
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,520
 if discontentment carries a terrible cost doesn't it

382
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,200
 just Mordecai's presence

383
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,560
 caused everything that was in Haven to come rushing out of him

384
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,400
 his pride

385
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,520
 discontentment please note this discontentment is always always without fail rooted in pride

386
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:28,240
 and it's pride that says you know what I deserve more yes I I deserve everything that I've received

387
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,680
 but you know what I also deserve for that little Jew to respect me

388
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,600
 as long as he doesn't none of this other stuff means anything to me

389
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,400
 because he is not exulting me

390
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,800
 but discontentment is also rooted in in gratitude

391
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,360
 and in gratitude reveals that we think we're responsible for what we have

392
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,240
 and when these two things come together it ensures that satisfaction is a goalpost that is

393
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,400
 constantly moving away from you

394
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,000
 you do the same thing don't you

395
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,080
 we're actually more like Hamin in the story than what we like to admit

396
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,680
 you know what God has been so good to me I have I have so many things I've got a wonderful home

397
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,960
 and I've got my health and I've got my family and I've got some money saved away and I've got a

398
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:44,640
 job that I enjoy and I just have so many things but you know what I won't be truly satisfied

399
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,120
 until I get blank whatever

400
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:58,640
 when we did Ecclesiastes look through Ecclesiastes we saw that the heart the human heart is never

401
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:05,040
 truly satisfied with things if we make things the object of our lives then we're continually going

402
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,400
 to be discontent

403
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,560
 we're more like Hamin in the story than we like to admit Hamin was an idolater and his idol

404
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,600
 as revealed was public respect he wanted everyone to acknowledge his greatness and when someone

405
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:27,520
 didn't do what he demanded the idol of his heart was challenged and he was angry and discontent

406
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,920
 no wonder the apostle Paul said that godliness with contentment is great gain

407
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,960
 and thankfully the gospel frees those who have come to faith in Christ from craving the

408
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,720
 approval of people why because you have been loved and accepted by god you don't need the

409
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,440
 world to revolve around you when you realize that god is actually at the center of everything

410
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,920
 and you are not when you realize that everything's about god not about you and this is the opposite

411
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,560
 of the advice that Hamin received the advice Hamin received is do whatever you have to do to be

412
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,080
 happy and if that is building a gallows 50 feet high or 50 qubits high and and hanging more to

413
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,200
 tie on it then so be it that's what you got to do then do it and be joyful now because you've

414
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,480
 gotten that one thing that stops you from enjoying everything else but you know what had he hung

415
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:30,320
 more to tie than he would have been upset about something else this revealed the orientation

416
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,680
 of his heart

417
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,640
 god often allows difficulties to expose the orientation of your heart

418
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,960
 so we see this truth in both Esther and in Hamin so my question to you is this

419
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,120
 to whom do you turn when life is difficult

420
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,320
 when we think back about the story then we think about the truth that Esther turned to someone who

421
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:12,960
 had the power to help in her time of need but Hamin turned to himself and to those who would feed

422
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:23,680
 as ego Esther was humble and selfless Hamin was arrogant and self-centered

423
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:35,440
 so when difficulties arise in your life do you turn to god or do you turn to self

424
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,600
 and then as I think about this in a larger picture

425
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:57,200
 I see really a beautiful truth here Esther had to go to a king and she hoped that he would accept

426
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:06,720
 her and she hoped that he would listen and she hoped that he would do what she asked him to do

427
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:14,320
 that he would provide deliverance for her and for her people but you know what as believers as

428
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:20,320
 those who are in Christ we need to see really something beautiful and that is this that we have

429
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:31,440
 a greater king to turn to and he bids us to come in to him and to everyone who comes to this king

430
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:39,440
 through faith in his son then this king is an ever present help in time of trouble he is a friend

431
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,720
 who sticks closer to the brother he is a friend who has promised never to leave you or to forsake you

432
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,640
 you don't have to ever be worried about being turned away from this king

433
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,640
 you don't have to worry about being ignored by this king our king has a throne that is established

434
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:05,680
 forever and there is no power above his power so he has the ability and the compassion to help

435
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:18,720
 you in the times of your difficulty our king knows everything our king sees everything our king

436
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:27,920
 is all lies so when difficulties arise listen brother and sister if you are in Christ if you are saved

437
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:37,840
 you have access provided to you to this king so turn to him and trust him and look to him for the

438
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:44,080
 help that only he can provide to you the psalmist put it this way I lift my eyes to the hills from

439
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:54,640
 whence does come my help my help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth we have a better

440
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:04,640
 king than any earthly king and we can approach him but the orientation of our heart must be humble

441
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:13,120
 and selfless not arrogant and self-centered let me ask you one final question I'm done

442
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,880
 do you see difficulties as an opportunity to trust God and grow in salvation

443
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,920
 that's what they're there for God is not some

444
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:39,760
 vindictive person who loves to inflict pain on people there's a purpose for the difficulties

445
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,160
 that we face and the scripture tells us clearly that the difficulties we as his people face are used

446
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,480
 for our good to make us more Christ like and ultimately for his purpose

447
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:59,680
 the difficulties reveal the orientation of your heart

448
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,280
 what are the difficulties you go through reveal about you father thank you

449
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,280
 for the truth of your word thank you for hard truths

450
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:24,800
 Lord today I've done the best that I can do to open your word to explain it to your people

451
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:33,440
 so that they might understand and apply it I thank you that you are our great king who can be

452
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,600
 approached and the Lord that we have the right to approach you not because of anything that we've

453
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:44,720
 done but because our faith is in a crucified risen savior your son whose blood made it possible

454
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:51,840
 for us to come boldly before you're thrown and to make our petitions known Lord I pray if there

455
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:57,120
 are those in this audience today those who are watching online even who have never put their faith

456
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:03,440
 and trust in you Lord perhaps they they think that they can approach you by themselves that they

457
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:10,160
 don't need to put all of their hope and confidence in the work of another that they think wrongly

458
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,840
 that you can be impressed by the things that they do in the way that they do them Lord I pray that

459
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:24,400
 you would open their eyes to the the fallacy of that thinking Lord that they would realize

460
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,960
 and understand that there is nothing they can do to impress you there's nothing that they can do

461
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:37,120
 to earn a place in your presence well Lord that they might turn to Christ in faith believing that

462
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:43,120
 Jesus is your son that he was sinless that he died on the cross in their place for their sin

463
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,120
 that he's risen from the dead and in putting their faith and trust and hope in him Lord

464
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,360
 you will save them you will make them a new creation father you will adopt them and bring them

465
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:06,240
 into the family and you Lord will be an ever-present help in time of trouble you are a great king

466
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,440
 whom we love and serve father I pray that you would help us to see the purpose of our difficulties

467
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,600
 that you might be glorified in them for we pray it in Jesus name amen let's stand in worship
