 Find if you would Esther chapter 5, the fifth chapter of the book of Esther. You know, some might
 look at the story of Esther and see only a series of coincidences. Well, you know, it's just a
 coincidence that the king and a drunken stupor would call out to the queen Vashty and insist that
 she present herself in front of himself and other drunken men in a way that would degrade the
 office of queen and therefore she said that she would not come and she was eventually deposed
 because of that action which then opened the door for a new queen. We might look and say, well,
 you know, it's just a coincidence that Mordekai and Esther remained in Susa. It's just a coincidence
 that Esther would have found favor in the eyes of those to whom she was responsible and
 that she would eventually find favor in the eyes of the king and be elevated to the role of queen.
 Some would say it's just a coincidence that Mordekai, the Jew, was in the gate when he overheard
 two of the king's guards discussing a plot to assassinate the king, which he was then able to go
 until Esther and Esther told the king and the plot was discovered and stopped sparing the life
 of Ahashwaris. Some would say, well, it was just a coincidence that Haiman was promoted for reasons
 that are never revealed to us in the narrative of Esther. But eventually he was put into position
 whereby he could convince the king to issue an order calling for the extermination of all the Jews
 in the Persian Empire. Just a lot of coincidences. It was just a coincidence that Esther then was
 in position to be able to potentially do something to help. A lot of coincidences.
 But what if I told you that there really is no such thing as coincidence?
 What if I told you that, you know, coincidences is something that we think of. It's a term that we think in,
 but coincidence doesn't truly exist like we think it does. Yet it's part of our lexicon.
 It's part of the lexicon of our lives. We constantly talk about coincidences. If you were to go to
 the store today and meet somebody that you hadn't seen since you were in high school or in college,
 you would think, wow, what a coincidence that we are together in the same store at the same time
 walking down the same aisle and we came together today. We think of and we speak in terms of
 coincidence, but there's no such thing as coincidence. What if I told you that there are times when
 God brings difficulties that are not coincidental, but God brings difficulties and those difficulties serve
 a greater purpose than you might understand. Look with me at Esther chapter number five beginning
 in verse number one. On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of
 the King's palace and front of the King's quarters while the King was sitting on his royal throne
 inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace. Now you're going to see here in verse number
 one the repetition of the word royal. She put on her royal robes. He was sitting on his royal throne
 inside the palace. The intent of the author is to paint a picture for us that these people
 were not hanging out in some ordinary place doing something ordinary. This is something extraordinary.
 This is something outside the realm of what we would consider normal for ourselves that this is
 situated, that this is set in an extraordinary place during an extraordinary time and we see people
 who are extraordinary in human perspective but just ordinary creations of God as we look at it from a
 divine perspective. Look at verse number two and when the King saw Esther standing in the court she
 won favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand then Esther
 approached and touched the tip of the scepter and the King said to her what is it Queen Esther?
 What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of my kingdom. And Esther said if it
 pleased the King let the King and Hayman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the King
 then the King said bring Hayman quickly so that we may do as Esther has asked so the King and Hayman
 came to the feast that Esther had prepared and as they were drinking wine after the feast the King
 said to Esther what is your wish? It shall be granted you and what is your request even to half the
 of my kingdom it shall be fulfilled then Esther answered my wish and my request is
 if I have found favor in the sight of the King and if it pleased the King to grant my wish and
 fulfill my request let the King do is the King and Hayman come to the feast that I will prepare for
 them and tomorrow I will do as the King has said and Hayman went out that day joyful and glad of heart
 but when Hayman saw Mordekai in the King's gate that he neither rose nor trembled before him
 he was filled with wrath against Mordekai. Nevertheless Hayman restrained himself and went home
 and sent and brought his friends and his wife Zerash and Hayman recounted to them the splendor of his
 riches the number of his sons all the promotions with which the King had honored him and how he had
 advanced him above the officials and the servants of the King then Hayman said even Queen Esther let
 no one but me come with the King to the feast she prepared and tomorrow also I am invited by her
 together with the King yet all of this is worth nothing to me as long as I see Mordekai the Jew
 sitting in the King's gate then his wife Zerash and all his friends said to him let a gallows 50
 cubits high be made and in the morning tell the King to have Mordekai hanged upon it then go joyfully
 with the King to the feast this idea please Taman and he had the gallows made Lord God you're good to
 us in gathering us together in a place where we can freely open your word read it hear it proclaimed
 and explained father we know that we required divine aid to understand it and to apply it
 and so God I pray that you would give that aid now that we would see this not just as a story that
 took place a long time ago in a land far away but Lord that we might understand the purpose
 for which you have given this to us and that it might impact our lives Lord I pray that you would
 enable us to see clearly that which needs to be seen and understood and applied for your glory
 for the greater purpose that you have for our lives as your people so father open our eyes help us to
 see and understand we pray it in Jesus name amen you know God often allows difficulties to expose the
 orientation of your heart that's one of the things that we see in this text we see a time in the
 history of the Jews that was exceedingly difficult they were in fact looking at and facing not just
 the possibility of extinction but the promise of extinction for nothing that they had done truly
 this whole thing comes back to the the reality that Mordecai made Hayman mad and Hayman instead of
 just simply trying to deal with the problem by dealing with one man has said no no no that's not
 enough someone like me needs to make a bigger splash and so I'm going to make sure that all of the
 Jews in the entire kingdom pay for what this one man has done it's a time of great difficulty
 and I know that we typically speak in the language of coincidence but C.S. Lewis attribute is
 attributed to have said coincidence as God's way of remaining anonymous you know God's name is not
 mentioned throughout this book and yet we see that God is on every page that God is the one who
 is moving all of the pieces that God is the one who is sovereignly and carefully behind the scenes
 orchestrating every act to bring about his greater purpose he is orchestrating every move to do that
 which he is determined to do to deliver his people from annihilation and thereby fulfill the
 promise that may he made to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and our sovereign God the same God who is
 working behind the scenes in the story of Esther that same God is just a sovereign today as he was
 when this event was taking place that same God is just a sovereign today as he has ever been he
 is sovereign he remains sovereign and he will often don't miss this he will often allow difficulties
 to assail you because he wants to expose you to the orientation of your heart he wants to pull
 back the curtain so that you can see how your heart is oriented and one of the ways he does that
 is by bringing us into difficult situations and scenarios now from a human perspective we don't
 like the sovereignty of God and let me tell you why we don't like the sovereignty of God because
 if God is sovereign that means we're not right and and we don't like the idea of someone other than
 ourselves being in control I don't like to ride with anybody in a car I'm serious I don't when
 my kids were learning how to drive scared the fire out of me why because I'm not the one behind the
 wheel therefore I didn't teach them how to drive I let Rebecca do it and I would ride with them
 right before they took the test I like to feel as though I'm in control and when I'm reminded from
 the truth of God's word that I am not in control in any way it doesn't always sit well with me
 just a minute ago you all sang to the top of your lungs we will trust in you
 perfect savior strong defender we will trust in you you know what it's really really really
 easy to sing those words isn't it it's an entirely different thing when we are put into a situation
 whereby we must actually trust him when we realize that we truly have no control whatsoever
 and the only thing that we can do is to step back and say okay God I have to trust you
 with my child I have to trust you with my spouse I have to trust you with my finances I have to
 trust you with fill in the blank oh standing among a group of believers listening to beautiful
 music being played by the band and singing out we will trust in you that is so easy but when
 you actually have to do it you have to acknowledge the truth that God is the sovereign one and that you
 are not and because we don't like the sovereignty of God we begin to look at things and the things
 that people do specifically and the things that happen in the world around us and and we begin to
 declare that that God can't be sovereign in the way that scripture defines sovereignty and
 declares sovereignty why because if God is sovereign then why are all of these terrible things
 happening around us why do we see so many sinful things playing out on the stage in front of us
 if God is truly sovereign in the control of everything then surely he could stop these bad things from
 happening listen God's sovereignty and human responsibility are not in competition against one
 another the men and women in this story they were not being controlled as passive figures
 when I was a kid I loved GI Joe and Transformers I would get home from school and I would watch really
 three cartoons Scooby-Doo amen right I may not get another amen the rest of the time from some of you
 but I said Scooby-Doo and you're like preach it brother um transformers and GI Joe and I would get
 GI Joe toys and transform transformers toys and for Christmas and for my birthday and and I would
 play with those toys the crazy thing about it is that when I laid those toys down on the ground they
 didn't pick themselves up and positioned themselves in battle ready positions right toy story is fake
 it's just a cartoon they don't really do that and if I left them on the ground and walked it away
 then when I came back they would be right where they were in the position in which I left them
 I had to act upon them I had to move their arms and their legs and their head I had to transform
 Optimus from semi mode to robot mode I had to do that and we sit there and think
