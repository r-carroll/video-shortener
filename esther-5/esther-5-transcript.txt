 Find if you would Esther chapter 5, the fifth chapter of the book of Esther. You know, some might
 look at the story of Esther and see only a series of coincidences. Well, you know, it's just a
 coincidence that the king and a drunken stupor would call out to the queen Vashty and insist that
 she present herself in front of himself and other drunken men in a way that would degrade the
 office of queen and therefore she said that she would not come and she was eventually deposed
 because of that action which then opened the door for a new queen. We might look and say, well,
 you know, it's just a coincidence that Mordekai and Esther remained in Susa. It's just a coincidence
 that Esther would have found favor in the eyes of those to whom she was responsible and
 that she would eventually find favor in the eyes of the king and be elevated to the role of queen.
 Some would say it's just a coincidence that Mordekai, the Jew, was in the gate when he overheard
 two of the king's guards discussing a plot to assassinate the king, which he was then able to go
 until Esther and Esther told the king and the plot was discovered and stopped sparing the life
 of Ahashwaris. Some would say, well, it was just a coincidence that Haiman was promoted for reasons
 that are never revealed to us in the narrative of Esther. But eventually he was put into position
 whereby he could convince the king to issue an order calling for the extermination of all the Jews
 in the Persian Empire. Just a lot of coincidences. It was just a coincidence that Esther then was
 in position to be able to potentially do something to help. A lot of coincidences.
 But what if I told you that there really is no such thing as coincidence?
 What if I told you that, you know, coincidences is something that we think of. It's a term that we think in,
 but coincidence doesn't truly exist like we think it does. Yet it's part of our lexicon.
 It's part of the lexicon of our lives. We constantly talk about coincidences. If you were to go to
 the store today and meet somebody that you hadn't seen since you were in high school or in college,
 you would think, wow, what a coincidence that we are together in the same store at the same time
 walking down the same aisle and we came together today. We think of and we speak in terms of
 coincidence, but there's no such thing as coincidence. What if I told you that there are times when
 God brings difficulties that are not coincidental, but God brings difficulties and those difficulties serve
 a greater purpose than you might understand. Look with me in Esther chapter number five beginning
 in verse number one. On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of
 the King's palace and front of the King's quarters while the King was sitting on his royal throne
 inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace. Now you're going to see here in verse number
 one the repetition of the word royal. She put on her royal robes. He was sitting on his royal throne
 inside the palace. The intent of the author is to paint a picture for us that these people
 were not hanging out in some ordinary place doing something ordinary. This is something extraordinary.
 This is something outside the realm of what we would consider normal for ourselves that this is
 situated, that this is set in an extraordinary place during an extraordinary time and we see people
 who are extraordinary in human perspective but just ordinary creations of God as we look at it from a
 divine perspective. Look at verse number two and when the King saw Esther standing in the court she
 won favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand then Esther
 approached and touched the tip of the scepter and the King said to her what is it Queen Esther?
 What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of my kingdom. And Esther said if it
 pleased the King let the King and Hayman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the King
 then the King said bring Hayman quickly so that we may do as Esther has asked so the King and Hayman
 came to the feast that Esther had prepared and as they were drinking wine after the feast the King
 said to Esther what is your wish? It shall be granted you and what is your request even to half the
 of my kingdom it shall be fulfilled then Esther answered my wish and my request is
 if I have found favor in the sight of the King and if it pleased the King to grant my wish and
 fulfill my request let the King do is the King and Hayman come to the feast that I will prepare for
 them and tomorrow I will do as the King has said and Hayman went out that day joyful and glad of heart
 but when Hayman saw Mordekai in the King's gate that he neither rose nor trembled before him
 he was filled with wrath against Mordekai. Nevertheless Hayman restrained himself and went home
 and sent and brought his friends and his wife Zerash and Hayman recounted to them the splendor of his
 riches the number of his sons all the promotions with which the King had honored him and how he had
 advanced him above the officials and the servants of the King then Hayman said even Queen Esther let
 no one but me come with the King to the feast she prepared and tomorrow also I am invited by her
 together with the King yet all of this is worth nothing to me as long as I see Mordekai the Jew
 sitting in the King's gate then his wife Zerash and all his friends said to him let a gallows 50
 cubits high be made and in the morning tell the King to have Mordekai hanged upon it then go joyfully
 with the King to the feast this idea please Taman and he had the gallows made Lord God you're good to
 us in gathering us together in a place where we can freely open your word read it hear it proclaimed
 and explained father we know that we required divine aid to understand it and to apply it
 and so God I pray that you would give that aid now that we would see this not just as a story that
 took place a long time ago in a land far away but Lord that we might understand the purpose
 for which you have given this to us and that it might impact our lives Lord I pray that you would
 enable us to see clearly that which needs to be seen and understood and applied for your glory
 for the greater purpose that you have for our lives as your people so father open our eyes help us to
 see and understand we pray it in Jesus name amen you know God often allows difficulties to expose the
 orientation of your heart that's one of the things that we see in this text we see a time in the
 history of the Jews that was exceedingly difficult they were in fact looking at and facing not just
 the possibility of extinction but the promise of extinction for nothing that they had done truly
 this whole thing comes back to the reality that Mordecai made Hayman mad and Hayman instead of just
 simply trying to deal with the problem by dealing with one man has said no no no that's not enough
 someone like me needs to make a bigger splash and so I'm going to make sure that all of the Jews in
 the entire kingdom pay for what this one man has done it's a time of great difficulty and I know
 that we typically speak in the language of coincidence but C.S. Lewis attribute is attributed to
 have said coincidence as God's way of remaining anonymous you know God's name is not mentioned
 throughout this book and yet we see that God is on every page that God is the one who is moving
 all of the pieces that God is the one who is sovereignly and carefully behind the scenes
 orchestrating every act to bring about his greater purpose he is orchestrating every move to do that
 which he is determined to do to deliver his people from annihilation and thereby fulfill the
 promise that may he made to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and our sovereign God the same God who is
 working behind the scenes in the story of Esther that same God is just as sovereign today as he was
 when this event was taking place that same God is just as sovereign today as he has ever been he
 is sovereign he remains sovereign and he will often don't miss this he will often allow difficulties
 to assail you because he wants to expose you to the orientation of your heart he wants to pull
 back the curtain so that you can see how your heart is oriented and one of the ways he does that
 is by bringing us into difficult situations and scenarios now from a human perspective
 we don't like the sovereignty of God and let me tell you why we don't like the sovereignty of God
 because if God is sovereign that means we're not right and and we don't like the idea of someone
 other than ourselves being in control I don't like to ride with anybody in a car I'm serious I don't
 when my kids were learning how to drive scared the fire out of me why because I'm not the one behind
 the wheel therefore I didn't teach them how to drive I let Rebecca do it and I would ride with
 them right before they took the test I like to feel as though I'm in control and when I'm reminded
 from the truth of God's word that I am not in control in any way it doesn't always sit well with me
 just a minute ago you all sang to the top of your lungs we will trust in you
 perfect savior strong defender we will trust in you you know what it's really really really
 really easy to sing those words isn't it it's an entirely different thing when we are put into a
 situation whereby we must actually trust him when we realize that we truly have no control what
 so ever and the only thing that we can do is to step back and say okay God I have to trust you
 with my child I have to trust you with my spouse I have to trust you with my finances I have to
 trust you with fill in the blank oh standing among a group of believers listening to beautiful
 music being played by the band and singing out we will trust in you that is so easy but when
 you actually have to do it you have to acknowledge the truth that God is the sovereign one and that you
 are not and because we don't like the sovereignty of God we begin to look at things and the things that
 people do specifically and the things that happen in the world around us and and we begin to
 declare that that God can't be sovereign in the way that scripture defines sovereignty and
 declares sovereignty why because if God is sovereign then why are all of these terrible things
 happening around us why do we see so many sinful things playing out on the stage in front of us if
 God is truly sovereign and control of everything then surely he could stop these bad things from happening
 listen God's sovereignty and human responsibility are not in competition against one another
 the men and women in this story they were not being controlled as passive figures
 when I was a kid I loved GI Joe and Transformers I would get home from school and I would watch
 really three cartoons Scooby-Doo Amen right I may not get another amen the rest of the time from
 some of you but I said Scooby-Doo and you're like preach it brother um transformers and GI Joe
 and I would get GI Joe toys and transform transformers toys and for Christmas and for my birthday and
 and I would play with those toys the crazy thing about it is that when I laid those toys down on
 the ground they didn't pick themselves up and positioned themselves in battle ready positions right
 toy story is fake it's just a cartoon they don't really do that and if I left them on the ground
 and walked away then when I came back they would be right where they were in the position in which I
 left them I had to act upon them I had to move their arms and their legs and their head I had to
 transform Optimus from semi-mode to robot mode I had to do that and we sit there and think that
 the sovereignty of God is much like that that God is pulling all of the strings that we're just
 animatrons and and we're puppets and and we are moved into position and and we do things just
 according to the way he wants them to be done and that is a simplistic view of the sovereignty of God
 we see here that God is is behind everything that is taking place and that God is orchestrating
 everything that is taking place every move that is made every step that is taken that sounds like
 that song right every move you make every step you take I don't know why I went there but it's just
 in my head we think that okay he did this and he did that and so God caused this and God did this
 listen God is behind everything that is going on but he is also working through
 the actions of the people involved in the narrative these people were not compelled to act contrary
 to their wills but God worked through their actions to accomplish his purposes Peter
 described this for us when he preached on Pentecost talking about Christ he said this Jesus delivered
 up according to the definite plan and for knowledge of God you crucified and killed by the hands
 of lawless men it was God's purpose for Christ to come and to live and to die on the cross this
 was set in motion before the very foundation of the world but yet God used the sinful actions of
 human beings as the tools whereby what God had willed to happen actually took place make sense
 and that's what we see happening here God is behind the scenes God purposes what is going to take
 place and yet he uses the actions the good and even the sinful actions of the people involved to
 accomplish that purpose one author said God achieves his perfect goals not just through our best
 intentions and most self-sacrificing acts but even through our greatest sins and compromises
 now maybe that's not something that brings comfort to you but as a sinner that brings great comfort
 to me I'm glad to know that my sinful acts don't re-derail the plan and purpose of God
 but God is so great and so powerful and so sovereign that he can take even the sinful things that I do
 and turn them and use those to accomplish his purpose and glory and sometimes because of our actions
 and sometimes because of nothing that we've done God who is sovereign and control of all things
 brings difficulties but God sees to it and here's what I don't want you to miss God sees to it
 that for his people the purpose of those difficulties is never ever wasted in other words we don't
 just go through hard times to go through hard times God is not some sadistic vindictive being who is
 up there thinking you know what how can I make them suffer how can I make life difficult just
 because I can no for the believer every single thing helps to accomplish the purpose of God in us
 and in the world and so what do the difficulties of life accomplish how how to difficulties expose
 the the orientation of the heart well this story does not provide for us an exhaustive list of the
 ways that God uses difficulties to accomplish things in our life but there are two conclusions that
 we can draw from the difficulties presented in this chapter the first is this that Esther when
 difficulty came became selfless now the author shows us in chapter five the Esther we've come to know
 from chapter two so if you remember the flow of the story Esther was not seen in chapter one she
 comes into onto the scene in chapter two whereby she's elevated to the role and office of queen she's
 not seen again in chapter number three she enters the scene a second time in chapter four and then
 the first part of the narrative in chapter five is really focused on this woman Esther and some
 of the things that we see in chapter five are the same things that we saw about her in chapter two
 so we see essentially the same person however we see the same person who is now using who she is not
 for her own selfish ends but for a selfless purpose so just to bring you up to speed on what's going
 on here at the end of chapter number four Esther had learned the plan of Hayman he she had learned the
 edict that had been sent out throughout the kingdom that all of the Jews were going to be annihilated
 that all of the Jews were going to be killed and the destruction was complete that it was exhaustive
 that if this plan was carried out not one single Jew would be alive in the entire Persian kingdom
 she had no idea that that was even a thing she was just living in the walls of the palace going
 on about her luxurious life and then she heard from Mordecai that this thing had happened and her
 initial reaction if you remember was in essence wow that sounds really really bad sorry
 if I go to the king and try to talk to the king about this unannounced I could lose my own life
 that's not really part of my plan and so good luck that's essentially what we see in chapter four
 and then Mordecai sends another message to her and the other message is this okay Esther
 you know what you think you're safe in the palace they know you're a Jew now and so you're not
 actually safe there any more than what we are outside of the palace but we know that deliverance
 for the Jews is going to come from some other place you and your father's house are going to die
 but maybe just maybe who knows is the language given to us in chapter four who knows if you have
 attained this position in the kingdom for such a time as this for this purpose to do something
 about the situation and to that Esther responded okay we're going to fast for three days myself
 and my maids and tell all of the Jewish people to fast for three days and then I will go in and break
 the law and see the king and if I perish I perish I might lose my life for this and if I do at least
 I died for something doing something instead of doing nothing so we come to chapter five
 and we see some really laudable characteristics of Esther that she employed in chapter two
 to ascend to the throne and now she's using them for a greater higher purpose notice
 what it says about her on the third day what does it tell us it tells us that Esther was prepared
 it tells us that she took the responsibility of of going before the king to present the petition to
 save the people very seriously so much so that she fasted for three days now some people like to say
 that prayer is implied in the fasting but the narrative the text doesn't actually say that prayer
 is took place that prayer happened and so we're just going to act like because it's not in the text it's
 not really something that should guide our thinking maybe she prayed we don't know we do know that
 she fasted and that fasting was most likely a time to prepare herself physically mentally and maybe
 even spiritually to take a huge risk to go before the king without being invited
 and so she prepared herself much like she prepared herself to go into the king the first time in
 chapter number two she was prepared notice what else she put on royal robes she was thoughtful
 she understood that you know what I'm not going to Walmart and my pajamas and crocs
 why do people go to Walmart and pajamas and crocs I don't understand that if anybody can explain
 that to me I would maybe like to hear that maybe not I don't know but she she knew that she had a
 serious responsibility a serious job so what did she do she put on the robes of royalty
 she put on her queenly garments the finest in the kingdom she put the crown on her head
 she prepared herself to gain an audience with the king something to be said about preparation
 she prepared and she was thoughtful much like she was in chapter two when she said what is it
 that the king likes what is it that I can do then we see that she stood in the inner court
 and that she waited to be acknowledged now she clearly didn't go into the throne room because
 had she gone into the throne room the king this is verified by historical documents the king
 would have had behind him a couple of guys one maybe two wielding axes and so if she had just
 rushed right into the throne room one of those guys would have just flew and taken off her head
 no one was allowed to go into the king's presence without being invited first so what did she do
 instead of thinking that she because she's the queen had a right to do what nobody else could do
 no she she got to where she was within his line of sight and maybe I don't know this is speculation
 perhaps the light hit a jewel in her crown in such a way or a jewel that she was wearing in such a
 way that the light refracted off of that and and the king's eye and he turned his attention to
 see her and when he saw her what did he do he held out the scepter which then allowed her to come
 into his presence and she came in and she did so not rushing into his presence not with bravado
 not with any kind of arrogance but she came in humbly and she touched the scepter
 and she said if it pleased the king she understood her role she understood her position
 and she exercised great humility and then she went to work and what we see in the rest of this half
 of the narrative is really Esther executing a plan that she had thought through very well
 well she was skillful in what she did and how she did it she said if it pleased the king
 let the king and hamin why not just the king why hamin too because she knows what she's doing
 one of the things that we can tell about Esther from the narrative is that she evidently had
 a propensity and ability to read people as she knew how to put people into places so that
 the maximum of effect and benefit would would take place meeting with the king alone wasn't the
 goal no she wanted hamin to be there as well and so she says come to the feast today that I
 prepared for you the king so the king then calls out bring hamin he's got to come so we can go
 together quickly to meet with the queen and have dinner and so they had dinner and then they were
 drinking and then the king says to Esther a second time what is it that you want so this tells us
 that the king knew and understood that Esther wanted something it wasn't that she just wanted to
 prepare a meal for him she wanted something he knew that now he's a pretty ignorant foolish guy
 but he was able to pick up on this so she must have been dropping some pretty hefty hints
 what is your wish it shall be granted you what is your request even to half my kingdom it shall be
 fulfilled now half my kingdom was hyperbole he wasn't planning on giving up half the kingdom what
 he was telling Esther is this I have the power to give you what you ask what you ask for trust me
 all you have to do is ask what is it that you want
 so she continues my wish and my request is now in the Hebrew it seems as almost if there should
 be an ellipsis here dot dot dot there's a pause my wish is some people speculate that she lost
 her nerve here that she was fully planning on saying listen Heyman has convinced you to kill all
 of my people I need you to rescind that order but I don't think that's what's going on here
 I think what's happening is she's skillfully fishing let me explain
 she's put the the bait on the hook she's cast the lure out into the water and she's pulling it in
 and and maybe just as the king gets a little bit close she yanks it a little bit and peaks the
 king's interest just a little bit more and and then she starts reeling it in more and the king
 is coming closer and closer and and he's just about ready to take a nibble and she yanks it again
 and she's trying to set it just in the right position so at the right time the king bites
 and then she can make a request known she says as much here she says listen come to a feast tomorrow
 that I'm going to prepare for them not notice something in verse number four she said I prepared a
 feast for the king but down in verse number eight she says that she's prepared the the feast for
 she will prepare the feast for them the king and Heyman well Heyman is like wow you're preparing a
 feast for me and then she says this tomorrow I will do as the king has said I'll tell you tomorrow
 I want to think you have to understand here is this is a this is a complex issue and it's a
 risky issue what she's asking the king what she will ask the king to do is no small thing that's why
 I believe she didn't just barge right in and just blab right out right she was skillfully working
 the problem to achieve the desired end the story is told of Alexander the great who marched
 his army into Turkey and he was shown the knot of Gordius and the knot of Gordius was a knot
 that was so huge and so complex that it was humanly impossible and tie but the legend was any man
 who could successfully untie the knot would rule over all of Asia so when Alexander the great
 and his troops marched into Turkey he was introduced to and presented the knot of Gordius and he was
 told the story and so he began to mess with the knot the story goes for a few minutes became
 frustrated as everybody was watching him fail at untying this knot and he essentially thought you
 know what it doesn't say how it needs to be untied he took his sword and hacked the knot to pieces
 so that it fell apart right in front of everybody Esther could not take such a simplistic approach
 why because there was something called the law of the Meeds and the Persians the law of the Meeds and
 the Persians was irrevocable when a Persian king set forth a law that law could not be rescinded
 even by the king's own order Daniel was familiar with this why because when Darius the Persian king
 enacted a law said no one can work pray to anybody but you for the next 30 days and Daniel did it
 the king regrettably threw Daniel into the lion's den why because he had to follow his own law
 and for a Persian king to fail to follow his own law would be a self admitting failure that he
 himself did not have the strength the power the force to execute his own word and so Esther
 coming along saying listen you need to write off this law so that the Jews aren't killed it would
 have made the king look unbelievably bad feckless powerless in front of his people so Esther needed
 to manufacture to do things in such a way that there'd be very very hard for the king to wiggle out of
 a promise that he's made so follow along Esther what is your wish you will have it Esther what is your
 wish you will have it up to half of my kingdom tomorrow i'll tell you king Esther what is your
 wish three times the king will have promised to give Esther what she's looking for Esther is a smart girl
 she knows what she's doing she's putting the king into a position where it would be almost
 impossible for him to deny her request and so we see Esther many of the same traits on display in
 chapter five with which she won favor in the eyes of all who saw her in chapter two and eventually
 won the grace and favor of the king these things are once again on display she's prepared she's
 thoughtful she's humble she's skillfully executing her plan only this time she worked to help others
 instead of herself and that leads to a question what changed this woman how did she move from
 only being concerned about herself in chapter two and again in chapter number four to actually
 risking her own life a very real risk to to put in action a plan to save others well perhaps she
 came to realize that that she was the one who was to stand in the gap and do what no one else was
 in position to do no God did not need Esther but Esther had been elevated to this place at this time
 for this purpose and so eventually she put the needs of others before herself now some people
 believe that that Esther is a type of Christ I don't necessarily embrace that type of
 biology but I do think that there is initially a contrast between Esther and Jesus in that
 Esther initially was like no I'm not willing to get involved but Jesus came to be involved
 that he came to seek and save those who are lost that that Jesus is the one who came not for his
 own purpose and not for his own glory but he came to do the will of the Father and the book of
 Philippians tells us that Jesus obeyed the will of the Father and became obedient to the place of
 death or the point of death even death on the cross and earlier in the text Paul says that brothers
 and sisters are to deal with each other in the same way in the church that we're going to have the
 same mind in us and what is that mindset that we think not only of ourselves but we think of the
 needs of other people and we place their needs ahead of our own therefore we live and we serve
 God by serving others and this is what we see then Esther doing after she was initially selfish
 in her response she became selfless and she realized that the needs of others far super seated
 her own need to try to stay safe in the kingdom and so it's not about me anymore it's about others
 it's about putting my life on the line for others and I'm so thankful that I can stand up here today
 and I can tell you that Jesus Christ put his life on the line for us when death was certain
 he gave himself on the cross not because he needed to die for anything that he had done but he
 should die so that we can be saved he died in our place and for our sin but there's something
 else we need to see about Esther and it is this that Esther shows us that God gives us ability
 and intends that we use those abilities for his purpose just think through this text with me again
 God is the one who made Esther beautiful
 God is the one who gave Esther the personality that he gave her
 God is the one who allowed Mordeky to hear the plan of the assassins
 God is the one who here moved the king to show favor to Esther so that Esther could come forward
 and then she used the personality and the character traits that God had given her
 for God's purpose not her own
 let me ask you has God made you skillful with anything
 maybe you're skillful in landscaping maybe you're skillful in computer code maybe you're skillful
 in wordworking maybe you're skillful in house cleaning maybe you're skillful in school whatever God
 has made you skillful has God given you a great mind he's given you intelligence
 has God given you a personality that attracts people I don't have that personality but some of you do
 has God given you strength an internal fortitude a strong will a spine of steel physical strength
 has God made you introverted here's the point
 however God has made you and whatever God has given you use it for his purpose
 all of it and by the way if God has made you a male live as a male for his glory if God has
 made you a female live as a female for his glory here's the thing God didn't make a mistake when
 he made you he didn't make a mistake when he created you to be who he desires you to be
 God does not mess up and we sit there and think well if I was only this or if I only had that then
 then you know I could really be used of God that's wrong thinking use whatever it is God has given you
 for his purpose and be selfless as Christ was selfless
 when Esther understood the magnitude and effect of the difficulty that confronted her we see here
 that Esther went from being self-centered to being selfless and the second conclusion is that
 Heyman was self-centered and Heyman's an interesting character and we'll spend a little bit of time
 not a whole lot but basically in verses 9 through 14 the author shows us a side of Heyman that is
 quite familiar to us Heyman was pretty much all about Heyman his name means one who is magnificent
 and there was nobody who thought Heyman was more magnificent than Heyman himself he just loved
 himself and you know what after having been invited to a private dinner for the king with Esther
 and then before he got to leave that day he heard that Esther was going to then produce a dinner
 not just for the king but for Heyman the first is like hey you're an invited guest come and enjoy
 the benefit of my feast the second one is hey this feast is just as much for you Heyman as it is for
 the king and Heyman man he left the palace that day happy right I mean he walked outside of the
 dining hall there and I could imagine that the the sky was blue and the sun was shining bright
 and there was a cool breeze perfect temperature that day the birds were tweeting his praises Heyman
 is great Heyman is great he's like I am it
 he was filled with joy and that's really what Heyman lived for he lived for joy he lived for his
 own personal happiness it's something that the author of this story wanted to make sure we understood
 because there's an inclusion here in Ecclusio in verse number nine it says at the beginning of
 this paragraph that Heyman went out that day look at the word joyful and glad of heart then drop
 down all the way to verse number 14 and you'll see after he receives the the advice from Zoresha's
 wife and his friends it says what then go joyfully so joyful is it the beginning joyful is at the end
 Heyman was all about his happiness Heyman was all about his joy whatever made him happy whatever made
 him joyful that's what was important to him no matter the cost and everything was going fantastic
 for Heyman until he walked to the gate and he sees Mordecai this insignificant little pest of a Jew
 who won't even stand there's no way that Mordecai was going to to genio fleck for Heyman here at
 this point and it says that he didn't even tremble I can imagine Mordecai is thinking to himself
 or Heyman is thinking to himself you know what I have turned the king's attention
 and purpose to issue an edict that's going to exterminate your life it's not now but at some point
 you're going to die and and you still won't tremble in my presence don't you know who I am
 and notice how quickly Heyman went from joyful and glad of heart to being filled with wrath
 against Mordecai here he faces opposition and things didn't go the way he wanted them to go and he
 was filled with wrath and he became extremely discontent you have to read this story with some
 imagination right because this next part quite literally makes me laugh every time I read it
 because Heyman the magnificent one he restrained himself he didn't just reach out and take care
 of Mordecai at that moment most likely he was thinking your time's coming I'll wait but then he
 goes home and he's feeling pretty bad about himself at this point everything was great now it's
 terrible all because the reaction of one dude and notice what he does he calls all of his friends
 together and calls his wife into the room and he starts talking about himself
 Heyman recounted to them the splendor of his riches hey do you know how rich I am
 you need to think for a moment about how much money I have and how little money you have
 I'm richer than you that's what's going on here and then he he he recounts to his wife this
 part cracks me up to he recounts to his wife the number of sons like she didn't know
 I can imagine that he's like babe we have this many sons and she's like oh tell me about it
 I was there when I gave birth to them
 basically what he's doing is he's writing a Facebook post on steroids right here he's like look
 at me look at me look at me
 Instagram praise me praise me I'm worthy of praise my little fragile ego is hurting because
 Mordecai hurt my feelings but you need to praise me
 he says you know what I've been promoted here's my medals
 here's my paste-ups as I've risen through the ranks above all the other surfants of the king
 and you know what even the queen Esther made a feast for the king and I got invited to it today
 and tomorrow she's making a feast for us
 I
 am the greatest
 I can see in my mind him recounting all these things with just the biggest grin on his face as
 he's talking about all of his possessions and all of his accomplishments and all of the
 accolades that he's received and all of the honor that has been heaped upon him and then
 he stops for a minute and he says
 but it all means nothing so long as Mordecai is alive
 it all means nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate
 if discontentment carries a terrible cost doesn't it
 just Mordecai's presence
 caused everything that was in Haven to come rushing out of him
 his pride
 discontentment please note this discontentment is always always without fail rooted in pride
 and it's pride that says you know what I deserve more yes I I deserve everything that I've received
 but you know what I also deserve for that little Jew to respect me
 as long as he doesn't none of this other stuff means anything to me
 because he is not exulting me
 but discontentment is also rooted in in gratitude
 and in gratitude reveals that we think we're responsible for what we have
 and when these two things come together it ensures that satisfaction is a goalpost that is
 constantly moving away from you
 you do the same thing don't you
 we're actually more like Hamin in the story than what we like to admit
 you know what God has been so good to me I have I have so many things I've got a wonderful home
 and I've got my health and I've got my family and I've got some money saved away and I've got a
 job that I enjoy and I just have so many things but you know what I won't be truly satisfied
 until I get blank whatever
 when we did Ecclesiastes look through Ecclesiastes we saw that the heart the human heart is never
 truly satisfied with things if we make things the object of our lives then we're continually going
 to be discontent
 we're more like Hamin in the story than we like to admit Hamin was an idolater and his idol
 as revealed was public respect he wanted everyone to acknowledge his greatness and when someone
 didn't do what he demanded the idol of his heart was challenged and he was angry and discontent
 no wonder the apostle Paul said that godliness with contentment is great gain
 and thankfully the gospel frees those who have come to faith in Christ from craving the
 approval of people why because you have been loved and accepted by god you don't need the
 world to revolve around you when you realize that god is actually at the center of everything
 and you are not when you realize that everything's about god not about you and this is the opposite
 of the advice that Hamin received the advice Hamin received is do whatever you have to do to be
 happy and if that is building a gallows 50 feet high or 50 qubits high and and hanging more to
 tie on it then so be it that's what you got to do then do it and be joyful now because you've
 gotten that one thing that stops you from enjoying everything else but you know what had he hung
 more to tie than he would have been upset about something else this revealed the orientation
 of his heart
 god often allows difficulties to expose the orientation of your heart
 so we see this truth in both Esther and in Hamin so my question to you is this
 to whom do you turn when life is difficult
 when we think back about the story then we think about the truth that Esther turned to someone who
 had the power to help in her time of need but Hamin turned to himself and to those who would feed
 as ego Esther was humble and selfless Hamin was arrogant and self-centered
 so when difficulties arise in your life do you turn to god or do you turn to self
 and then as I think about this in a larger picture
 I see really a beautiful truth here Esther had to go to a king and she hoped that he would accept
 her and she hoped that he would listen and she hoped that he would do what she asked him to do
 that he would provide deliverance for her and for her people but you know what as believers as
 those who are in Christ we need to see really something beautiful and that is this that we have
 a greater king to turn to and he bids us to come in to him and to everyone who comes to this king
 through faith in his son then this king is an ever present help in time of trouble he is a friend
 who sticks closer to the brother he is a friend who has promised never to leave you or to forsake you
 you don't have to ever be worried about being turned away from this king
 you don't have to worry about being ignored by this king our king has a throne that is established
 forever and there is no power above his power so he has the ability and the compassion to help
 you in the times of your difficulty our king knows everything our king sees everything our king
 is all lies so when difficulties arise listen brother and sister if you are in Christ if you are saved
 you have access provided to you to this king so turn to him and trust him and look to him for the
 help that only he can provide to you the psalmist put it this way I lift my eyes to the hills from
 whence does come my help my help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth we have a better
 king than any earthly king and we can approach him but the orientation of our heart must be humble
 and selfless not arrogant and self-centered let me ask you one final question I'm done
 do you see difficulties as an opportunity to trust God and grow in salvation
 that's what they're there for God is not some
 vindictive person who loves to inflict pain on people there's a purpose for the difficulties
 that we face and the scripture tells us clearly that the difficulties we as his people face are used
 for our good to make us more Christ like and ultimately for his purpose
 the difficulties reveal the orientation of your heart
 what are the difficulties you go through reveal about you father thank you
 for the truth of your word thank you for hard truths
 Lord today I've done the best that I can do to open your word to explain it to your people
 so that they might understand and apply it I thank you that you are our great king who can be
 approached and the Lord that we have the right to approach you not because of anything that we've
 done but because our faith is in a crucified risen savior your son whose blood made it possible
 for us to come boldly before you're thrown and to make our petitions known Lord I pray if there
 are those in this audience today those who are watching online even who have never put their faith
 and trust in you Lord perhaps they they think that they can approach you by themselves that they
 don't need to put all of their hope and confidence in the work of another that they think wrongly
 that you can be impressed by the things that they do in the way that they do them Lord I pray that
 you would open their eyes to the the fallacy of that thinking Lord that they would realize
 and understand that there is nothing they can do to impress you there's nothing that they can do
 to earn a place in your presence well Lord that they might turn to Christ in faith believing that
 Jesus is your son that he was sinless that he died on the cross in their place for their sin
 that he's risen from the dead and in putting their faith and trust and hope in him Lord
 you will save them you will make them a new creation father you will adopt them and bring them
 into the family and you Lord will be an ever-present help in time of trouble you are a great king
 whom we love and serve father I pray that you would help us to see the purpose of our difficulties
 that you might be glorified in them for we pray it in Jesus name amen let's stand in worship
